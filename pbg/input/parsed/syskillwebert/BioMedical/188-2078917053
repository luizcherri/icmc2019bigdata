We developed    the Web of Addictions for several reasons. We are concerned about    the pro drug use messages in some Web sites and in some use groups.    We are concerned about the appalling extent of misinformation    about abused drugs on the internet, particularly on some usenet    news groups. Finally, we wanted to provide a resource for teachers,    students and others who needed factual information about abused    drugs.         We take addictions seriously.
