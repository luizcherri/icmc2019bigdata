     Lateiner Dataspace Home Page                 Lateiner Dataspace: Visualization, Simulation, Dataspace                    [  Home  ] [  Papers  ] [  Tech Reports  ] [  FTP Site  ] [  Related  ] [  Comments  ]          Lateiner Dataspace Corporation      The Lateiner Dataspace site contains  information pertaining to research being performed at Lateiner Dataspace on high-speed volume visualization, discrete physical simulation techniques, and Dataspace distributed datastructures.  We invite other sites to submit URL's on related information for incorporation into our subnet, and we also invite the submission of materials to include.   The mission of this site is to provide a reference point for information regarding Dataspace related items, where Dataspace is a dynamic, distributed voxel database.  This would include works dealing with the rendering of voxel data, manipulation and simulation of voxel models, and distributed computing algorithms.   After you have finished exploring our site, feel free to submit comments using our    Comments Form     Please use the text-based or image-based navigation scripts at the top of each page to explore our extensive World Wide Web offerings.    Update:     Vox-L Inc.  was one of the first companies to license Lateiner Dataspace's volume rendering technologies (the MRI images in the greeting banner were generated using these algorithms).  Vox-L's Visualizer software has incorporated Lateiner Dataspace technology since 1992.  In 1994, Vox-L licensed additional technology, including an embedded version of Dataspace TM (our high-speed volumetric object database) for use in the Vox-L Visualizer (incorporating the database to power Vox-L's segmentation and classification tools).  In addition, Vox-L recently licensed the Dataspace Object Manager to power the  communication between the Vox-L Visualizer and Vox-L Extension processes built using the Vox-L API  (see  for more information ).   Vox-L Inc. has stated that their next goal is to license Dataspace simulation technology for incorporation into the Vox-L Visualizer to enable enhanced Virtual Surgery applications.
