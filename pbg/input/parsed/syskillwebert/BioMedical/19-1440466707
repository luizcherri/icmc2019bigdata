Using the   wwwstat  perl script (along with a GN version I modified) we can also generate    usage statistics   of our server.    This server has been developed and is maintained by    Hugh Chou  at the Institute for Biomedical Computing with assistance and advice from the Washington University   Office of the Network Coordinator  and the    Medical Library.
