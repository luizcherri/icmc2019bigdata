The resources are in the form of clickable hyperlinks to other sources and documents somewhere on the Net.  New users may want to look at the ICRIN  slide show  that presents an overview of the structure, content, and benefits of this site.   If you know of other Internet resources that would be appropriate, please fill out an  Add Form  or post a message to the  ICRIN HyperBoard  (bulletin board system) with the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) address and a short description of the resource. ICRIN will be updated at least monthly to reflect links to the new information.  ICRIN is a user of the       usage statistics service.

The INTVIO-L list serves as a networking system devoted to all aspects of family violence.

If a newsgroup is established you generally have to look at the postings, but you don't have to sign up to view the messages. However, you may need newsreader software to take full advantage of newsgroups and you must have access to a Usenet (NNTP) server.  Some WWW browsers like NETSCAPE have newsreaders built in but you still need access to a Usenet server.  There are thousands of newsgroups.  To automatically be sent copies of newsgroup messages related to a particular topic, explore the powerful capabilities of Stanford's  Netnews  Information Filtering Tool (SIFT).  SIFT enables users without access to a Usenet server to get filtered newsnet postings.
