     Welcome to BITMed               Welcome to the BITMed Simulation Server at the University of California, San Diego.  This server is unique in that the WWW hypertext is interleafed with true complex systems simulations of biological, chemical and physical systems.  We are presently building several virtual environments for the rational design of clinical trials and wetlab experiments. Our current simulators are invaluable tools for the teaching of neuroimmunology and HIV-induced disease to students at both the highschool and university levels.  We also support a number of   conferences .        Do you have the   necessary software   to run simulations on this server?        Topics of Interest           BITMed Research Overview     A synopsis of the laboratory's general mission as well as the   Directory of BITMed Members .       The Cybermouse Project     A collection of random field  simulators  for analyzing tissue samples of the murine animal model.   Applications  to the rational design of preclinical trials and to  AIDS research  are discussed.        The Virtual Wetlab     An environment for discussion, simulation, shared analysis, and the teaching of biomedicine.        The Virtual Reading Center     Mockup for testing interactive ophthalmologic research       Random Fields & Cellular Automata     Background information on random fields with sample cellular automata  simulators .       BITMed Library     BITMed publications, slides, press releases, and access to  BITMed's FTP site.  We also added a small number of links on how to write hypertext.       Conferences     Information concerning conferences on virtual reality, telemedicine, and other topics relating to BITMed.       TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER ZONE      This newest addition to our server transfers various technologies developed in our laboratory into the market place.  Because it is so new, this section is still under construction.       Simulator Index     Index to all simulation software packages currently accessible through BITMed's WWW server including the   interactive online simulators  run on the  CDM-DS .
