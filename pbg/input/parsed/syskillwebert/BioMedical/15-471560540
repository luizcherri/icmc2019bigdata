 PIR-Web  - The Protein Identification Resource        Search the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database (Parts 1, 2, and 3)               Searching for Proteins from Selected Species          The Web version derived from PIR-International has hot links to the following Databases:     GenBank  - DNA Sequence Database   DDBJ  - The DNA Data Bank of Japan   EC-Enzyme  - The EC Enzyme Classification Database   GDB  - The Genome Data Base   Refbase  - A Protein Sequence Citation Database     Many of which have links among themselves and to other databases as well.    Searching:    You may search this database using booleans (and, or, not), nested booleans, wildcards (*), and phrase searches ("   ").  The maximum number of results returned is currently 200.   For Example: A search for -     reverse and transcriptase      will pull out all the reverse transcriptases.   A search for -     reverse and transcriptase not immunodeficiency     will narrow the search down a bit by screening the HIV and associated entries.
