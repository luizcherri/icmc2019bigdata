 Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death        Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death     Hello and Welcome!     This page is currently under development, but stayed tuned for more improvements.  My name is  Alex Denner (denner@yale.edu)  and I am doing research in the prediction of sudden cardiac death at Yale.  Also, I would like to hear from anyone who is doing similar work or is interested in the field.  (See below.)    I am conducting research on: Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death.  This involves analyzing electrocardiograms to determine the likelihood of future episodes of ventricular fibrillation.  Soon I will put more information about my work here.     An electrocardiogram represents the electric potential, usually on the surface of the chest, that comes from the heart muscle.  The heart is comprised of four chambers.  Blood enters the heart into the two atria (left and right) and goes to the two ventricles (left and right).  The two atria contract simultaneously then, after a short delay, the ventricular muscles contract.  On the electrocardiogram "waves" can be seen which indicate the atrial contract, ventricular contraction, and, since the ventricles are large muscles, often the ventricular repolarization can be seen.  Currently, my work is concentrating on ventricular arrythmias, specifically the most serious, ventricular fibrillation.  Fibrillation is a state of the heart where the ventricular muscle fibers appear to be contracting and relaxing at random---they are not acting synchronously.  During fibrillation no blood is pumped by the heart.       This is an electrocardiogram from a Holter monitor  (It is a postscript file.)      I am trying to find a way to analyze the electrocardiogram to predict the likelihood of a given patient having an episode of ventricular fibrillation sometime in the future.  One of my favored techniques is wavelet analysis which allows the frequency content of the signal to be distinguished spatially.          To Those Interested in Cardiology/Sudden Cardiac Death/VF:   I would like to get together a mailing list or group of people who are interested in issues related to ventricular arrhythmias and/or ECG signal analysis.
