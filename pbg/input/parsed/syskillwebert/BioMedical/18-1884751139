     Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford            Center Description   The Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford was established in 1990 to create links between academic, research, and administrative computing activities in the  Stanford University School of Medicine , and to serve as a source of advice to the Deans office on  informatics  issues. The Center was then funded in 1992 by the  National Library of Medicine (NLM)  to create a shared computing resource to support research activities in biomedical informatics. This resource is also named CAMIS and supports an active core research program, the computing infrastructure and day-to-day computing needs of a large number of researchers, each of whom has external support from  NIH (the National Institutes of Health)  or other agencies through grants or contracts. Though the CAMIS resource is  Stanford -based, its mission has a national character, which includes support of national electronic mail distribution lists, extensive on-line information resources, an annual CAMIS symposium, three academic training programs, a visiting scholar program and a national advisory council. The nominal location of CAMIS is in the  Medical School Office Building (MSOB)  on the  Stanford University campus .
