       BIOSCI/bionet Electronic Newsgroup Network for Biology                  Welcome to BIOSCI!       BIOSCI is a set of electronic communication forums - the bionet USENET newsgroups and parallel e-mail lists - used by biological scientists worldwide.  No fees are charged for the service.  BIOSCI is currently supported in the U.S. by a grant from DOE with equipment from NSF.  The U.K. BIOSCI node is supported by the Daresbury Laboratory.         OUR NEW COMMERCIAL SPONSORS     Please thank them for supporting BIOSCI by clicking on their logos!                   ScienceBase product preview!     New Storm gel &amp; blot analysis system!       THE U.S. BIOSCI NODE IS CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR SPONSORS TO HELP CONTINUE ITS WORK WHEN THE DOE GRANT ENDS.  Sponsors will be able to have their logo listed in this space, have a hyperlink to their home page, and gain other advertising exposure through our gopher site and BIOSCI documentation.  Please contact  biosci-help@net.bio.net  for details on how your organization can help BIOSCI continue its service to the biology community.    BIOSCI promotes communication between professionals in the biological sciences.  All postings to the newsgroups should be made in that spirit.  While the general public may "listen in" to the discussions, these newsgroups are intended primarily for communications between researchers.  There are other forums on Usenet such as sci.bio for the asking and answering of biological questions from lay persons.
