The working association of researchers in animal disease and modelling at the two establishments extends over two decades and  this partnership was formally recognised in 1992.  The personnel comprising VIE are located in several Departments, with the administrative centres being the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Glasgow and the  Department of  Statistics and Modelling Science  at the University of Strathclyde.  The group is under the co-direction of Professor George Gettinby (Strathclyde) and Dr. Stuart Reid (Glasgow).    Back to Table of Contents        Mission    To provide an environment which will enable researchers from a variety of disciplines to contribute their scientific talents towards the improvement of animal health and welfare. The mission will be pursued by the application of basic and applied research. In particular, this will include quantitative epidemiology, statistical modelling and information science.    Back to Table of Contents        Activities       application of quantitative epidemiology and information technology to the investigation and management of disease.   development of biologically meaningful statistical models of both infectious and non-infectious disease.   conversion of data into knowledge by the use of appropriate analytical and modelling techniques.   production of knowledge bases containing clinical, pathological and molecular data suitable for clinical, research and educational purposes.   construction of expert systems resulting from the interrogation and analysis of clinical data sets.   planning and design of investigative studies.   publication and dissemination of findings.   promotion of collaborative scientific links with other universities and research centres.
