 Medical Informatics Home Page         Medical Informatics Research Group            Medical Informatics is a rapidly emerging and increasingly important  discipline aimed at exploring ways in which computer science methods  and techniques can contribute to, and benefit from, problems in  medicine and biomedicine.  The emphasis of our research group is on  graphics, visualization, animation, computer vision and knowledge based methods to model, simulate, analyze and visualize biomedical processes and structures.   The Medical Informatics Group is a part of Georgia Tech's     Graphics, Visualization, and Usability Center  .
