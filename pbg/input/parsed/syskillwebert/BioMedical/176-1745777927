(The counter was started on 1 July)            A  bout    T  hese    P  ages .  These pages serve a number of functions. First, you will find information about the Department of Food Science &  Nutrition at the University of Minnesota. This will aid you in learning something about who we are and what we do.  We offer a short  photographic tour of FScN  if you'd like to see what "we" look like. You can  also visit our individual  home pages .   In a more general sense, we also provide resources related to specific faculty, staff and student interests. We are  attempting to provide information relative to aspects of the study of food science and nutrition, in general. This  will range from our K12 page (providing links to some of the K12 programs we are involved in) to our Food-Law page  (providing information and links to sites relating to food law).   Finally, we provide a variety of specific resources to support our students, staff and faculty. This would include  materials for specific classes, newsletters and other announcements, and whatever other aids and links we can develop  to make our lives more coherent.   These pages are continually growing and changing. We are trying to find ways to make our information more obvious and  readily useful. We are in the midst of a new metamorphosis. As the pages shift and reshape themselves, I welcome your  feedback.
