This project combines both software and database development, seeking to provide alternative views into analyzed data.       Additional cDNA Sequence Analysis Projects at the Plant Molecular Informatics Center:    Rice, Corn, Pine and Others     In addition to the work with  Arapidopsis , other cDNA analysis projects have been undertaken by PMIC to transfer  sequence analysis tools  developed for  Arabidopsis  to other plants:       The   Rice cDNA Project   at the Rice Genome Research Program at STAFF Institute in Tsukuba, Japan;   The   Corn cDNA Project   at the University of Arizona;   The   Loblolly Pine cDNA Project   at the Institute of Forest Genetics, USDA Pacific Southwest Research Station of the Forest Service; and   A sequencing project for an anonymous client.       We are grateful for the cooperation of Carolyn Tolstoshev and Mark Boguski of NCBI's dbEST; their assistance and encouragement in this work has been invaluable and appreciated.    You may be interested in finding out about having PMIC process your sequences. (UNDER CONSTRUCTION. A link will be put in shortly.)   Note:  We have also applied these tools to other organisms, as seen in the   Zebrafish Project.                Alces Server     Home of the   Virtual Genome Center   with    information about   Candida albicans  molecular biology .             Neuroscience  Database Program     The main goal of this research is to provide an interdisciplinary environment that facilitates development of a zoomable database of brain structure and function.               Virtual Library            The PCR  In Situ     While the polymerase chain reaction provides an extremely powerful tool for the analysis of populations of cells, the PCR  In Situ  extends this  technology to the single cell level.  In part due to the newness of the technique, and in part to respond to demand for detailed information,  pre-prints of articles and in-press book chapters, as well as a cookbook of protocols, have been made  available .      Research Papers    The Computational Biology Centers has converted several of its  research papers  into a format for WWW browsing.                 The Hidden Layers: A Fluid Molecular Biology Didactic Platform    Teaching a course on state of the art molecular biology is challenging as the underlying technologies advance faster than print support media can accomodate.  In addition, the essential computational tools are generally ignored as the difficulty of supporting multiple platforms and capacities are virtually insurmountable.  This project   (A Recombinant DNA  Technology Course)  seeks to remove the barriers by using net-based resources [Mosaic], desktop publishing technologies, client-server computing, device-independent graphics and imaging and an array of computational tools operating on remote servers.      Web page creation    A set of pages containing   information  and tips, such as design considerations, for new web authors. Originally written for the Bio-Medical Library's Beginning WWW class.      On-line Software Documentation  Software documentation for several molecular biology programs and packages have been put on-line:      The  Staden Software Suite Manual , for sequence analysis and manipulation.  An unofficial  GCG Software Guide .   Zuker's Mfold Manual , for prediction of RNA Secondary Structure.  The  Oligo Selection Program , an aid in selecting oligonucleotide primers for DNA sequencing an PCR.   X-PLOR , used to determine molecular structure by X-ray crystallography and solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.   Other documentation , useful for making Web server pages.
