     Kuntz group welcome page         WELCOME TO THE KUNTZ GROUP!       The Kuntz lab consists of two groups: a "dockers" group, which is working on issues in structure-based drug design, and an NMR group.  The main focus of the dockers group is the development of tools for the discovery of lead compounds once the 3D structure of a target receptor is known.  Our best known tool is the program  DOCK , which searches databases of chemical structures for potential lead compounds for a particular receptor.  We've also been developing  BUILDER, for design of novel compounds to interact with particular receptor, and are experimenting with QSAR applications of DOCK.      DOCK 3.5  is now available!
