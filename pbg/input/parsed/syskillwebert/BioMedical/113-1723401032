      "SNORE Central"      S.N.O.R.E.    S leep ap N oea  O nline  R esource for  E ducation   Information on sleep apnoea and other sleep disorders     First things first, as a hex against all the stupid, greedy lawyers in the  world:   READ MY  DISCLAIMER!     Now, on with the show...           NEW! There is a  support group         for families of children suffering from Congenital Central        Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS).    Anyone want to volunteer to help with the FAQ?  I can't write the        whole thing myself!  Let me        know  if you feel qualified to write some answers.        This site is relatively new and still under construction.  There is not as much here now as I would like.  I'm counting on you, the visitors, to help change that.  So, please, if you have any... send me information.  I'm looking for whatever can be sent electronically (or even via snail-mail).  If you have informational files, papers, names, addresses, manufacturer info, sleep center info, articles -  whatever ! If you think it might be of any interest at all to OSA sufferers, please send it.  If you have comments or suggestions, send them, too - but no guarantees as to when they will appear; I only have so many hours in the day.

Some information is also included about other sleep disorders, but I have chosen to concentrate on the one which concerns me most closely.  If you have something to contribute on OSA, in any format, send it along and I'll format it and put it up here if I think it is of value.  If you have information about other disorders, you can also send that, but it must be pre-formatted (in HTML) and ready to go.      A great resource for information about other sleep disorders is   Dr. Michael Thorpy's home  page , which contains links to sleep-related resources of all kinds.    Hey!   read my resume!
