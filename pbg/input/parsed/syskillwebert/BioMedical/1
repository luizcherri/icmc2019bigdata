 HospitalWeb              Welcome to  HospitalWeb , a small but growing list of Hospitals on the Web.   This list is being compiled with the hope that more hospitals will take advantage of the amazing  potential of the World Wide Web.  Providing a  simple  and  globally accessible way for  patients ,  medical researchers , and  physicians  to get information on any hospital  in the world is the goal.      This list is of "main" webservers (only  webservers  at  hospitals  will be  listed).  Some hospitals currently have only scattered departmental webservers online  (due to the "grassroots" nature of the WWW, servers tend to spring up without  "top-level" administrative approval...[grin]), so I will  include them as need be. This list is definitely not complete.  If you run or know of  a hospital webserver, please  send me mail  and I will add it immediately!   This list is very small, but l expect it will grow quickly (if you work at a hospital  that doesn't have a webserver online, be sure to show them this list!).    Join the HospitalWeb Discussion List!  I've just set up a  listserv  for HospitalWeb.  Topics will be anything to do with  hospitals on the Internet and the WWW, and I hope it will grow into a discussion  forum where everyone can voice their opinions/questions about the future of  hospitals and the Internet.  If you want to join in this forum, please  send email to  hospitalweb@neuro-www2.mgh.harvard.edu  with the subject " help " for info on  how to subscribe.

Although I've seen  many  medical resources on the Web, I've  never  seen a  simple and complete list  of hospitals  on the web.  This has probably confused patients and physicians simply  looking for specific hospital information ( lists of specialists, email addresses for  physicians, specific departmental information, admitting information, clinical trials, maps, etc...? )  Hence, I've started this list on my own, and hope that  people will use it as a reference point.  Please  email me  if you have a hospital  to include!    I chaired  Workshop F: Webserver Applications for Hospitals and Medical Research Centers   at the  Third International WWW Conference  (April 1995) in Darmstadt, Germany.
