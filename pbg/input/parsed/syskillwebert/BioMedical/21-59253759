 Malaria Database    MALARIA DATABASE          Funded by: UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases    Maintained at: The Department of Microbiology, Monash University and The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research         Anonymous FTP site    This site contains a number of text files of nucleotide and protein sequence data. In one directory  directory  I list files that were included in the last mailout. In another  directory  are files added since then.  If you use the links below to grab any file, be aware that you will be getting the version sent in the last mailout, so you just may want to check the  new directory  to see if there is anything later. The files exist in several different formats:        Annotated Nucleotide sequences in EMBL format.  Beware that this is a  very large file  occupying about 4 Mb at last count.    Annotated Nucleotide sequences in GCG format.  Note: this directory contains thousands of files and takes a while to list in your web browser.   Unannotated nucleotide sequences suitable for importation into PC programs    Annotated Protein Sequences in EMBL format    Unannotated protein sequences suitable for importation into PC programs    List of expressed sequence tags of Plasmodial genes  These are included in  annotnuc.dat  but are separately listed here with BLAST search results for each EST.       Malaria Genome Information  This  list  tells you about known chromosome markers for the 14 chromosomes of P. falciparum. The list is cross-referenced to the database and the  probe list  so that you can identify a researcher who can supply you with an appropriate probe      Malaria strain information  The WHO funds a malaria strain bank that is maintained at the Institute Of Cell And Animal Biology, University Of Edinburgh by    Dr. David Walliker.   Listed here are the various isolates and cloned lines of malaria that are available by contacting David.       P. falciparum isolates   P.falciparum cloned lines   Mouse malaria strains      Availability of Clones and probes  This  list  gives you the name and addresses of researchers who can supply you with nucleic acid probes or cloned sequences.      Bibliography of references about malaria antigens  Here you will find listings of references about  several malaria antigens.  I try and keep this current but anyone who wishes to adopt an antigen, please do so.      Alignment of malaria antigen sequences  Some malaria antigens exist in multiple allelic forms. Here you will find alignments for  MSP-1 ,  MSP-2  ,  AMA-1 ,   Duffy binding proteins  and the family of  erythrocyte binding antigens.          Software tools of utility or interest       Malaria Discussion Group  This service provides a forum for discussion of any topics related to malaria. Details of how to join the discussion group are available  here.    Upcoming Conferences of Interest  Details of upcoming conferences of special interest to malariologists or parasitologists are available  here.    Projects and Grants of Interest      Environmental Health Project of USAID       Other Malaria and Parasitology Sites   This provides pointers to other sites of interest to parasitologists or tropical disease people.
