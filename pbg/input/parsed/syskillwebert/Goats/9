Dairy Goats  are raised for goat milk.  They  also make good companions, go to petting zoos, and we show them at fairs.     Pygmy Goats  are raised primarily for show.  Like  dairy goats, they are good companions, and they go to shows, fairs, and petting zoos.      Female goats are called does. Male goats are called bucks. We primarily raise does because  they are easier to manage, they don't have an offensive odor (unlike bucks),  and there are more shows for does.  A male goat that has been neutered is known as a  wether.  We usually don't keep dairy goat wethers, but some kids raise and show pygmy  wethers.  Other domesticated goats include  Boer goats  that are starting to be raised for meat,  Cashmere goats  that are raised for cashmere and  Nigerian Dwarf goats .  Domesticated goats differ from wild goats such as  Mountain goats .

Goats are very affectionate and especially during the summer, when they are too hot to be active, they like to just hang around people and get a good scratch.  Most goats' favorite scratchy spot is around their shoulder but some even liked to be scratched in between their toes.  It is very rewarding to see a goat you have raised from a baby grow up and have kids and grandkids of her own.  With goats that doesn't have too take too long, maybe about 3 or 4 years at most, because they are able to breed when they are just a year old.  It's also neat to learn how to milk or trim hooves and other things that you wouldn't ordinarily be able to do.         Goat Statistics       Body Temperature:  102.5&#176 F-104&#176 F    Pulse/heart rate:  60 to 80 beats per minute   Respiration rate:  15 to 30 breaths per minute   Puberty:  4 to 12 months   Estrus ("heat") cycle:  18 to 23 days   Length of each "heat":  12 to 36 hours   Gestation (length of pregnancy):    150 days     Breeding season:   Pygmy goats may be bred any time of the year.  Dairy goats  usually go into heat between August and January in the Northern Hemisphere.   Weight: An adult pygmy goat weighs between 50 and 75 pounds. An adult dairy goat  doe weighs between 125 and 200 pounds. An adult dairy goat buck weighs between 200  and 300 pounds.           A healthy goat     Eyes clear and bright.   Tearing or cloudy eyes probably mean a pinkeye infection.  Coat smooth and shiny.   A dull coat could indicate parasites.  Fluffed up coat means  the goat is not feeling well.  Appetite good.   However, it is normal for a doe in labor to refuse to eat.  Attitude alert.   Hunched back and droopy tail mean something is wrong.             Basic care   Like any other animal, a goat can survive without food for several days, but not without  water.  We provide automatic waterers in goat pens, and also leave a bucket of water.  In some areas, of the country, its important to make sure the water doesn't freeze, but we don't have that problem.   Although many goat owners feel that a twice daily feeding is best, others feed only once a  day and still have perfectly healthy goats.  You will have to decide what is practical for  your animal and your schedule.   Try to keep both food and water where they cannot be  soiled by the goat.    The basic food we feed is alfalfa hay. An adult  dairy goat doe eats about  1/2 flake a day  (about 5 pounds).  This is supplemented with a grain mixture that contains 14-16% protein depending on the additional needs of the goat:     Dairy doe in milk: 2-3 pounds   Pygmy doe in milk: 1-2 pounds   Dry doe:  0-1 pounds   Pregnant doe: (last 1-2 months) 1-2 pounds   Wethers: Usually given no grain.    We also provide either a loose mineral mix or a mineral brick. Since alfalfa hay is high in calcium, we make sure the mineral mix is high in phosphorous and low in calcium to maintain the proper calcium-to-phosphorous ratio.    Although this diet works for us, we suggest you consult with a local goat breeder or veterinarian who is more familiar with the nutritional needs of your goats and the nutritional value of the feed in your area.         Preventative health care    In our area, there are three types of injections that the goats need regularly: Tetanus toxiod, BoSe and a vacination for enterotoxemia. We give 1/2 cc. of tetanus toxiod yearly (usually one month before a doe is about to kid). BoSe contains selenium and vitamin E and is necessary to maintain muscle tone in adults and prevent "white muscle disease" in kids.  Because hay in our area is low in Selenium, our goats receive 1 cc. of BoSe intramuscularly for every 40 pounds of body weight twice a year.  The best time for bred does to receive BoSe is about one month before they kid and then 5 months after they kid. Babies should have their first injection at six weeks of age (1/2 cc), unless they need it sooner to correct a problem. For enterotoxemia the Clostridium Perfringens types C&D bacterin-toxoid vacination is given. It is often combined with a tetanus toxiod in brand names such as Bar-VAC CD/T or FERMACON CD/T. First course requires two doses at 21-28 days interval. The dose is 2ml SQ in the web of the elbow. Until recently yearly boosters were the norm, but vets are just now beginning to recommend twice yearly vaccinations.  When using the combined CD/T it is not necessary to have a separate tetanus toxiod vaccine.     Check with a local vet to make sure goats in your area need selenium, and that the doses we use are appropriate for goats in your area and the brand of injectible you use.  Overdoses of BoSe or injecting it to goats who receive selenium as part of their diet may be fatal.  In your area, additional vaccines for other diseases may be necessary.      We deworm our goats twice yearly: in the fall before breeding and in the spring immediately following kidding.  We use TBZ or paste wormers intended for horses ivermectin (Zimectrin) or pyrantel tartrate (Strongid C).  Caution: check the label or ask your veterinarian whether the product can safely be given to a pregnant goat.  Check labels for withdrawal time if you use the milk for human consumption.             Common  Diseases     Coccidia  are tiny intestinal parasites, actually protozoans, that can cause foamy, bloody diarrhea or a dull, dry coat.  Sometimes a goat with coccidiosis (coccidia infestation) has an on-again-off-again soft stool or no obvious symptoms at all.  You might not suspect a problem until you notice that your kids are not growing as well as they should.  Young kids up to four months of age are at highest risk and should be treated at least once with the medication Albon.  Our veterinarian recommends that they receive Albon for one week beginning at about three or four weeks of age and again if they are very stressed, such as when separated from their mother. If in doubt, take a stool sample to a veterinarian who regularly treats goats.       Ketosis  (also known  as pregnancy toxemia) may occur in pregnant does late in their pregnancy. The  doe  may be depressed,  weak, uninterested in food, and have poor muscle control and balance.    If untreated, death follows within a few days. Early  in  the  disease, many does will show a positive test for  ketone bodies in the urine.    Ketosis may occur  when the doe is carrying two or more kids, or when  the doe is very fat.  This disease is caused by the  sudden extra demand for energy by the fast-growing  kids in the pregnant goat and the inability of the goat  to eat enough  of her normal diet to provide  this energy  (due to the kids taking up room in the body). The doe will  rapidly  metabolize fat from her body stores produces ketones (a toxic  by-product) and the symptoms of the disease. Treatment with propylene glycol at  two to three ounces  twice a day will help.  If the doe lies down and cannot stand, treatment is usually not successful  unless she delivers at that time.     As a preventive measure,  do not let the doe  get fat early in pregnancy and in the last month  of pregnancy provide 1-2 pounds of grain in addition to hay.            Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Syndrome   (CAE) is a viral disease.  In young kids  symptoms include  a weakness in the rear legs, with no fever, or loss of appetite,  However,   the unused  legs  lose  muscle  strength  and  structure and the infected kids eventually die.   In older goats, the same disease is seen as  swollen joints, particularly the knees.   The disease develops slowly, and  after 2 or more years, the animal has difficulty using  its legs properly.   Infected goats have no fever,  remain alert, and eat well.  However, they do not  recover from the arthritis.   An inexpensive blood tests can be used to diagnose CAE.  The disease is spread from older infected goats to kids, perhaps by  contact or  through the milk from an infected doe to her kid. There are no corrective  procedures or treatments.  Isolating kids at birth and raising them on  pasteurized goat milk is done to prevent the spread. It's a good idea  to make sure a goat is CAE free before purchasing. However, the blood test only checks for antibodies, and it's possible that an animal is infected and not (yet) producing antibodies.     Mastitis   is  an  inflammation  of  the mammary  gland  (udder  or  milk-giving  gland)  of  animals,  usually caused by bacteria. The symptoms  of mastitis are heat,  pain,  and swelling of  the  udder.  Usually you will notice some discoloration of  the tissue and abnormal milk.   The infected udder  will change in color from slightly more pink to a  bright red, or to a black and cold udder. The milk from an  infected udder will vary in color,  texture,  and  thickness.   The California Mastitis Test (CMT) is  a good test for  subclinical mastitis, but is not 100% accurate.  Laboratory culture or  growth of the bacteria causing the mastitis is the best way to determine  the exact diagnosis.      The causes of mastitis are most commonly rough treatment  and unclean milking practices. Wash the goat's udder  before milking, and dip (or spray) the teats after milking  with a teat dip.  Wash your hands before milking each goat  to prevent the spread.  The treatment  consists  of an intramammary infusion of antibiotics, sometimes  accompanied by additional antibiotics. Consulting a vet  is important for this disease since there are many different bacteria  that cause mastitis and different antibiotics are best for each.  If untreated the infection spreads and the goat may die or lose the udder.           Breeding   A dairy goat should weigh at least 80 pounds and be at least 8 months old the first time she is bred.  A pygmy goat should be between 9 and 18 months and a good size for her age.  In order for the doe to conceive (become pregnant), she must be in estrus ("heat" or "season".)  Signs of estrus include flagging (wagging her tail), mucous discharging from her rear, mounting other goats, and excited behavior if she is near a buck.  At first, you'll probably breed your does to a buck of a local breeder, but eventually, you might want to consider  owning your own buck or artificial insemination .  A good indication that a doe is pregnant is that it does not come into heat on its next cycle, so check your goat carefully three weeks after breeding. It may be hard to determine if a dairy goat is pregnant if it was bred at the end of the breeding season.          Labor    The  expected due date   is 150 days after breeding.  A few weeks before delivery, the goat's udder will usually become enlarged.  A day or two before birth, the udder often fills up and the pelvic ligaments at the base of the tail relax so that the tail feels loose. Frequent urination and low pitched bleating are also signs that labor will begin within a day or two.  The first sign we usually notice that indicates that labor is imminent is the discharge of the mucous plug, followed by small amounts of mucous.  In our experience, this usually occurs an hour or two before birth.    In the uterus, the kid is enclosed in an amniotic sac which is surrounded by a water sac.  Usually the water sac bursts 30 minutes to 2 hours before the delivery of the first kid.  The amniotic sac might burst a few minutes before delivery.  Usually, a kid will be born front legs and head first, and no assistance is needed. In multiple births, each kid is usually delivery 5-30 minutes after the previous sibling, and the placenta is expelled a few hours later.          If the kids haven't arrived within two hours after the water sac breaks, or if the kid is not positioned properly, an experienced goat breeder or a veterinarian might be required to assist in the delivery by repositioning the kid or "pulling" the kid out.         Care of newborn goats    Usually, the doe will lick the kid, to remove mucous and to stimulate its breathing. With a weak kid or inattentive mother, you might want to make sure the kid is freed from the amniotic sac and the mouth and nose are free of mucous.  It is not necessary to cut the umbilical cord, but if there is excessive bleeding from the umbilical cord of the kid, we tie it with dental floss.  Within an hour of birth, we dip the umbilical cord in 7% iodine to prevent infections.   Usually within a half hour, the kids will attempt to stand and nurse. It is important that the kids nurse within the first few hours of birth to receive colostrum which provides immunoglobulins.   Before the kids reach ten days old, they are dehorned.  Before dehorning, we administer tetanus antitoxin to provide temporary protection against tetanus. Often at the time of dehorning male kids are castrated (also known as wethered). At one month of age, we usually give tetanus toxiod (repeated one month later for newborns) and BoSe. The BoSe is repeated every six months and the tetanus toxiod is repeated yearly.             Cost of raising a goat   Here are the approximate costs of items needed for raising a goat:      Purchase price: Expect to pay between $100 and $300 for a registered Dairy Goat kid and between $150 and $350 for a Pygmy Goat.    Feed: The cost of alfalfa hay in Southern California varies between $9 and $12 per bale, depending on the season and the feed store.  Grain costs about $9 per 50 pound bag.  One mature dairy goat eats approximately 1 bale of hay every 2 weeks   	Supplies:   Collar 	$6 Insecticide powder	$7   Hoof trimmers	$14 Milking bucket	$20 - $30  Grooming brush	$4 Kid nipples	60 cents    Medications:   Tetanus antitoxin	$2 for vial for three kids  Worming medication	$8 - $15 for 10 to 20 doses  	  Procedures:   Stud service	$25 to $75  Disbudding	$10 at Farm; $35 with a vet  CAE blood test	$6  Stool sample	$12 to $16 through a veterinarian            Sources of Goat Supplies     Specializing in the Goat   Caprine Supply  P.O.
