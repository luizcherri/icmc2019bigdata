     Cygnus People             Cygnus Support Animal Preserve          Welcome to the Cygnus Animal Preserve!  Cygnus animals, past, present, and future are electronically represented here.     Cats    Pati  and her husband Pete have two cats,  Bogart   and  Frodo .  Bogart  is the troublemaker of the two.     Stan  and Natalie have two cats,  Mackey  and  Velcro  . Mackey's name derives from the Mac the Knife (he was named by Natalie's daughter when she was young), while Velcro is notable for his clinginess. Eventually we'll add an illustration of this... At 14 and 18 pounds, Mackey and Velcro are both lapfuls!     Dawn  has 3 happy  fur balls  named Tiger, Slinky and Zipidie.  Tigers are wonderful things, Slinky thinks she's a spring, and Zipidie isn't so zippy now  that he's a whopping 18 pounds.  .   Dogs    Gordon's  roommate's dog,  Roque , is in charge of system security at  base.com .    Juno , the world's most spastic canine, can leap tall fences in a single bound,  chase cars with the grace of a penguin,  shatter glass with a single bark, and coat an entire arm with slobber in a single lick. If anyone dared enter his   master  's territory, they'd be loved to death in seconds.     Goats    Ian 's parents run a cashmere goat farm.  Here is a picture of   Lady , a doe imported from Australia, and two of her kids.  There are more goat pictures at the  Black Locust Farm  home page.    Pigs    Piggio  is a very happy pink pot pellied pig.  After a not terribly successful career as company mascot at 3DO, he hopes to change his name to Pignus and become Cygnus' new garbage disposal, in spite of the more popular notion that the job might be  better served by a goat. He's had some very interesting adventures and has his very own   web page  to tell you all about it.    Birds   Cygnus' animal preserve wouldn't be complete without a bird sanctuary, and in fact, you'll find one in  Dawn 's house.   At last count, there were 7 feathered squawkers and 10 more cooking in the nest. And well, you know what they say about big birds, "they make big poos". Here are some of their pictures if you'd like to meet some of them:    Cookie , the scary cookatoo,  Happy , the lonely cockatiel,  Cirrus and Tinsel , are two parakeets with half a brain each,  Yin , the lovebird who hates everyone,  Casper and Snowwhite , the albino cockatiels whose  eggs  won't hatch, and  Phoenix , the jeolous conure.    Fish    Stan  and Natalie also have a number of koi and goldfish in their outdoor pond.  In the summer, they like to come up to the surface and suck on your fingers. Perhaps someday we'll get a picture of the heron that has eaten several of our fish.  We usually keep a net over the pond to prevent any more such tragic events.    Everything Else    Herman  lives in a shell. He's very quiet, doesn't eat much, and doesn't get around too much. We often wonder if he's still alive.
