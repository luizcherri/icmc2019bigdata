   Digital Tradition Folk Song: SWALLFLY (4807)         SWALLOWED A FLY   [ text score  or  songwright  or  audio ]   SWALLOWED A FLY (Alan Mills?)  I knew an old lady who swallowed a fly      Perhaps she'll die.  I knew an old lady who swallowed a spider That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her She swallowed the spider to catch the fly      Perhaps she'll die.  I knew an old lady who swallowed a cat Just think of that! She swallowed a cat. She swallowed the cat to catch the spider That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her She swallowed the spider to catch the fly I don't know why she swallowed the fly      Perhaps she'll die.  I knew an old lady who swallowed a dog Oh what a hog! To swallow a dog, She swallowed the dog to catch the cat She swallowed the cat to catch the spider That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her She swallowed the spider to catch the fly I don't know why she swallowed the fly      Perhaps she'll die.  I knew an old lady who swallowed a goat She just opened her throat and swallowed a goat She swallowed the goat to catch the dog She swallowed the dog to catch the cat She swallowed the cat to catch the spider That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her She swallowed the spider to catch the fly I don't know why she swallowed the fly      Perhaps she'll die.  I knew and old lady who swallowed a horse (spoken) She died, of course.  Note: I've heard improvs with other animals, but this seems to be      the core story.
