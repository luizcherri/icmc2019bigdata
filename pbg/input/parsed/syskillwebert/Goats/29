     Who am I?              Who am I?            Well for those of you who are really interested:-    I am a first year undergraduate at the   University of Warwick  reading   Mathematics  and  Computation .    If you are really keen, you can even have a look at my   timetable .             Some people like to call me a goat, so just to satisfy them, I have included a large  picture  and a page of   goat links!       Gavin Porter    (gavinp@dcs.warwick.ac.uk)
