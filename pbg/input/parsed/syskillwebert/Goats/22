 Open Pygmy Goat Champions    GRAND CHAMPION PYGMY GOAT NAMED   Carol Shea, Jerseyville, Illinois   Cheny's Grove Kids Little Willie   Carol Shea,  from Jerseyville,  and her Pygmy Buck Cheny's Grove Kids Little Willie walked away from the  1994 Illinois State Fair  Open Pygmy Goat Show as Grand Champions on   Saturday, August 13, 1994 .   Cheny's Grove Kids Little Willie took first in the Yearling Buck and his first ever Grand Champion place.   Before this momentous achievement,  Cheny's Grove Kids Little Willie was treated like any other goat;  however,  from now on,  he will receive "preferential treatment,"  according to Shea.   Reserve Grand Champion was Blands Farm Jake,  owned by Tori Walters, from Tampico.       Return  to 1994 Illinois State Fair Home Page.      Illinois State Fair
