 Email to Kittens and Goats Organization      Email to The Kittens and Goats Organization        We are a non-profit, all volunteer organization who care for stray animals, everything from kittens to goats.    Thank you for all the wonderful letters that we have received over the past year.   We are often asked for pets, but unfortunately we do not have the money or the legal department to properly document  and ship animals across state lines. Sorry, we recommend you  visit the your local SPCA  and save an animal from destruction.     Please do not send us money or any more pet food. If you  like what we do, please join us by  saving animals in your local community.    Note: This is an HTML form. You must have a browser that supports forms in order to use it.
