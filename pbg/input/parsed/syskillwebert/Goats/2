   The Goat Shrine       The Goat Shrine   This page is fondly dedicated to Heidi Geshel, who knows the joys of  living in a goat-infested room and who also gave me the wit and  inspiration to do this page!           GOATS!  GOATS!  GOATS!  GOATS!  GOATS!   GOATS!  GOATS!      Why are Goats so Cool?  Oh, c'mon, just look at them.  They're amazing.  Not only are they cute,  but what other animal are you going to find that both eats your garbage   and  can make its own milk?  Exactly.  Besides, goats are just cool  by nature.  They make great sources of consolation in times of grief,  plus there are many unconfirmed rumors that they also make good sex  counselors too.      The Beard:  An Evolutionary Link  Truly, Darwin was on to something.  Think about it.  Goats have beards.   People have beards.  Hmm...could it be we that we and goats have a closer  family bond than we'd previously believed?  And if so, why, goats may be  on par with monkeys, dolphins, and white mice in intelligence.  Why, this  practically makes goats family to us!     Fear from the Masses  Yes, that's right, most people just can't handle the power that  goats represent.  That's why our society is trying to put them down and  repress the danger that goats hold for the weak-willed's stagnant and  close-minded ways of life.  Goats offer us freedom--a new and enlightened  way of life that will help us transcend the mundaneness of the everyday  world and take us to the ultimate level of perfection that we possess within  ourselves.  So don't be decieved by claims that goats are only good for  milk and cheese or angora and cashmere.  Realize that those beliefs are  only the last-chance efforts of a desperate group of people trying to  pose as a stumbling block to the new order.   Only by knowing the truth  can you become free.        How Did I Become Hooked?  Well, I really don't know.  This hobby/interest/obssesion of mine has  been going on for a few number of years now, but I can't quite pinpoint  how it started.  Mostly I think I saw some goats at a fair and was struck  by how cute they can be.  Plus, liking goats isn't quite the same as  liking dolphins or puppies, so the attention/amusement factor I get from  this is worth it.  Besides, the quest for finding goat &quotthings&quot  isn't easy, so it makes for a fun time.  However, the love of goats is a   double-edged sword which isn't always easy to wield.  One example was  when I took my niece (who was 3 years old back then) to a petting zoo  which had goats who were  intent on mobbing her and eating her clothing.  I &quotrescued&quot  her, and she's recovered quite nicely  since then (thanks to many readings of &quotThe Three Billy Goats  Gruff,&quot)  but the whole incidence just shows that  goats have a dark side   that can be unleashed if their power isn't properly reckoned  with.       My Goats  For those of you that care (and heck, I'm impressed if anyone's actually  read this far!), I have my own collection of goats.  Ok, they're not real  live goats, but I think terming them as merely inanimate is harsh, as  these goats definitely have a personality and prescence all their own.   Here they are, in the order I obtained them...     Inspector Gadget's Goat :  Yeah, I realize it's a pathetic  name, but it's the closest he's got.  He's just a small, brown plastic  goat and he has an equally small plastic Inspector Gadget figurine riding  him, hence the name.   The Straw Goat :  Another lack-luster name, but again, very  descriptive.  The Straw Goat is a self-standing goat made out of straw  who is no more than a foot high.  He was given to me by my friend  Anjanette, who obtained him from a store in Florida that bears his name.   Kimball :  Kimball is the &quotflag-goat&quot of my  collection.  He's a small stuffed white goat (whose picture can be seen  in various parts of my home page) who was given to me by my friend  Stacy.  Kimball's been a constant companion and has even survived a trip  to Hell (Michigan) and back.   Kelsey :  Kelsey is a small porcelin ornament of a brown goat  with a carrot in his mouth.  I got Kelsey for Christmas from John  Wallace, who was my Secret-Santa at the time.  Right now, Kelsey is  perched on my desk guarding my book collection.   Kalliope :  Ok, there's some discrepency that Kalliope might  actually be a llama, but we're not really sure.  She's a small (tiny,  even) stuffed red goat with neat designs on her.  David got her for me in  the Carribbean, which by the way, is a virtual haven for free-running goats.   Kassidy :  Kassidy is practically Kimball's twin.  The only  difference between them is the color of ribbon they wear around their necks  and the shade of brown that their horns are.  Kassidy was a gift from  John and Heidi, and she has seen me through many troubled times.   Gadriel :  Gadriel is the newest addition.  He's a  very   big goat with gray fur and vivid blue eyes.  He was purchased at the Ann  Arbor Street Art Fair for me by David, and due to Gadriel's size, hugging  him is almost like hugging a real goat.  Of course, I've never actually  hugged a real goat, and I'm guessing that hugging Gadriel is probably a  more enjoyable experience.          More Goat Sources...   Yes, they do actually exist, and here are the ones that I recommend:    The Irvine  Mesa Charros 4-H Club's Goat Page --This is a great source for real  goat info and facts, complete with tons of pictures, sounds, and diagrams.  These are some really good goat pictures that I could never get to save  for my page.  Check them out  here  and  here.    Back to  Richelle's Homepage   Last Updated:  July 30, 1995
