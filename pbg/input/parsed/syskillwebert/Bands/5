    Adam Bomb                Stand On Up                           (Excerpt 120k, 180k / Full song 4:06 mins, 2.95M, 5.91M)          HipHop-Rap ,   College/Indie/Lo-Fi                                        Biography     Adam Bomb has lived behind "enemy lines" for most of his life, much to his dismay. As a white male, he watched his fellow Anglo-Americans create and perpetuate racist, prejudiced and sexist ideals. With his self-produced debut of "Organic Hard-Core" Rap he is out to unsettle the status quo and give them a dose, from one of "their own", of something that they have been deaf to for far too long... the TRUTH.                              Adam Bomb's rhymes defend individual freedom, attack authority and define true liberty which, to him, is more than just privileges for the advantaged few. His music throbs and grooves with funky samples, rock and funk inspired guitar tracks, keyboards, and live horns.    "Government, religion, and social standing are not excuses for racism, sexism, oppression and censorship by the powers that be," Adam Bomb says. "The Constitution was a great document, in theory, but its ideals have not been afforded, to this day, to all men and womyn equally. It has never been anything more than a fairy tale to many of the people who in large part built this country, but have to ask permission to share the dream."   His tracks confront everything from racist attitudes of the powers that be, to sexism and the failing two-party political system. "Stand On Up", inspired by a Malcolm X speech warn all races that things haven't changed enough to relax on any level, and that action like that of the 60's Civil Rights movement is still a must:     'Cause if you're sittin' then you're just a sittin' duck  Lettin' those who choose, bombs instead of schools  Still vote for the sucker, if ya vote at all fool    In "Peacemaker, Soulshaker", Adam Bomb serves up other ideologies he disdains -- misogyny, organized religion, bigotry and violence among all races of people who should be fighting the system rather than smoking dope, drinking "40's" and killing each other.    "The System" calls for an end to the two-party system which as Adam Bomb sees it is a farce. "Although the two groups make a lot of noise espousing different points of view, they are essentially the same. They have their own best interests in mind and the true needs of the masses are not even an issue".     My vision  Destroy the institution  With an urge ta purge suckers that are usin' up the masses  Mutha fuckin' facists, I won't be passive  Better believe I'm down for somethin' drastic...  Enough of this evil  Politicians gonna keep ya in submission till ya feeble    "Everybody Get-A-Gun" takes a sarcastic swipe at those in our society who are obsessed with firearms.     Mother don't cry, he only thought he was protecting you  Not expecting to  Take out his own son, with a cap from his own gun  The same gatt we used ta shoot for fun...  The Second Amendment  Nothin' more than a remnant of our past  The Second Amendment  Propaganda from a Klansmen in my path    By attacking long since established views, values and philosophies, Adam Bomb is prepared for criticism from middle America. He is also prepared for the Hip-Hop and Rap communities to come at him as well by virtue of the fact that his skin is white. "I've seen it happen, and quite frankly in many cases, people got what they deserved. I feel my music is different. My lyrics are relevant and I am not wasting people's time to fill my pockets. It's people's minds I hope to help set free".   Realizing his passion for expressing himself through music at an early age, Adam Bomb formed a band with his brother when he was barely out of elementary school. He went from high school to study sound design at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. It was during his college years that Adam Bomb discovered a powerful from of expression that spoke to him and the ideals that he believed in vehemently. He walked in to a record store one day and knew that in Rap he had found his niche. "I heard Public Enemy in a local store, and their message and delivery inspired me to change my outlook on music", Adam Bomb recalls. "Chuck D's lyrics were intelligent, deep and pertinent." Chuck D, KRS-1 and Ice Cube became his strongest Rap influences.   Adam Bomb's first project was producing a young rapper named Stud B. As Adam Bomb learned about rap as an art form, he began producing tracks for both himself and Stud B, that were both political and original. Songs like "Earth to the White Man" and "Proof is in the Pudding", which was a reaction to the Rodney King beating, were results of the pairs collaboration.   Now a resident of Los Angeles, Adam Bomb continues to grow and evolve as an artist. He keeps his ears, heart and mind open for innovative sounds and ideas and persists at expressing the truth, which he hopes will force those "in charge" to finally own up to their wrongs and relinquish the power to those who should have had it all along.

I got your tape in the post this morning. i listened to all of it before coming in to work. it really is great, 'organic hardcore' just about describes it for me.  a couple of the tracks have got double vocals on them - are they both you? - one at a higher pitch than the other, this sounds a lot like early PE, I'm thinking of 'megablast' especially.  I also picked up house of pain & ratm (your voice - in places) styles, yet not derivative, more expansive.  I'll be playing your tape on my show tonight.
