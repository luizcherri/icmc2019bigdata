    Clan Diah                Sky Sign                           (Excerpt 160k, 240k / Full song 5.1 mins, 3.68M, 7.35M)          College/Indie/Lo-Fi                                       CLAN DIAH   To a ground work of massive bass sound, add the drive of stormy, trippy drums, thick and spicy guitars plus mature, haunting vocals and you have (with the occasional Celtic bagpipe and penny whistle)  Clan Diah . Emotionally charged and deep in meaning, Clan Diah produces sways from indie rock to heavier alternative. It's no wonder their appeal to the college scene keeps growing. Clan Diah is eclectic, yet ironically maintains a balanced, cohesive sound. They flow through a whole gamut of styles and sounds, but each song is uncontrived and honest. This sophisticated approach makes for timeless music. Clan Diah is song oriented with a communication of both mood and thought. This Cincinnati based quartet capitalizes on dynamics all through their debut CD " The Train Journey North ." If you haven't heard them have a taste and enjoy the Cincinnati style cookin'.        About the songs available on IUMA...     SKY SIGN : This tribute to the unseen fully explores the use of dynamics. It refers to the sense that we believe in many things not yet seen, or invisible. We can see the future by study of the past and we can see the invisible by the results it produces. This song has interesting changes in time signature and moods. It trips, it flies, it spirals out of control. What is communication but transfer of ideas and moods? Words too are invisible and yet still exist.    MIST COVERED MOUNTAINS : Simply Complicated and sadly beautiful. Christopher shows off some of his piping abilities on this piece. Originally composed by an unknown source in the early 1800's, this piece is sometimes rendered with Gaelic (trad. Scottish language) lyrics but more often the haunting melody is left alone to tell the tale of a traveler longing for the mist covered mountains of his home. This tune was a favorite of the late King George the VI and was played at his funeral. It was also played at the funeral of President John F. Kennedy. Highland bagpipes, acoustic guitar, and the distant harmonies of the whistles will leave an impression.    SYMBOL OF MY SHAME : Very Emotional! This song demonstrates the winding melodies and thick guitars. Listen hard and you'll hear Jay's marching band past. This song is rich in meaning. It refers to the moving irony of the feast of Christ's last meal. It was caused by man's failure, yet caused man's redemption. He said it symbolized His death and His blood. He then gave thanks to God for it and ate it.            These three songs are only a taste of Clan Diah's independently released CD "The Train Journey North" which is available by sending $11.00 plus $2.00 postage and handling to....   Clan Diah  265 Emming Street Apt. #3  Cincinnati, Ohio 45219         Some more stuff for those who care...    HISTORY OF CLAN DIAH   In Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1991 a few college friends started writing songs. Clan Diah, as a band started with the stereotypical ritual of arguing over what to name the band. They settled on "Clan Diah" which is an old Scottish phrase meaning "the children of God." This subtle reference to the divine nature of our humanity came from the Scottish influence of one of the members, Christopher McLennan, who is a nationally awarded bagpipe performer. After the name was chosen the band started playing out at local venues and coffee houses in the Cincinnati area.   Over the years the band did some quick recordings of songs for a demo tape. One song ("Matter of Time") actually ended up on a nationally distributed compilation CD. With the confidence built by a very supportive local fan base, the success of the demo tape, and playing at a national music festival, the band embarked on its most ambitious endeavor yet...   In July of 1994, Clan Diah went into the studio to start recording its first full length compact disc. This self produced, independently released, and personally financed album is a statement of the band's abilities, commitment, and pro-active nature.   Clan Diah continues today to develop its loyal following. The band is presently shopping labels to give themselves the freedom to fully explore their potential. They wish you the best and hope you enjoy their work. See you on the "Train Journey North."        MEMBERS OF CLAN DIAH...
