    Mouthbreather                Mouth Mix of Pre-Digested Juicy Tidbits from the Bytes                           (Excerpt 141k, 211k / Full song 4.5 mins, 3.50M, 6.99M)          Humor                                     What is Mouthbreather?  -  Mouthbreathers on  Mouthbreather   -  Song Descriptions                    WRITING TEAM CREATES BOFFO CD AFTER RELEASE FROM  HOSPITAL FOR CRIMINALLY UNEMPLOYABLE      The  comedy  writing  team  of   Carol  Lee   and   Steve  Sea    were released  from  the  Washington  State  Hospital  for  the   Criminally Unemployable today  to  promote  their  new  CD,   Mouthbreather:  Humor for  the  Totally  Incorrect,  Performed  by  the  Puget  Sound  Bytes . The pair, who met when the  poles  of  their  portable  IV's  of   Maintainizine  collided  on  their  way   to   shock   treatment   therapy, apparently  were  left  to  their  own  comedic  devices  when  the  TV broke in the day room last week.   "I've listened to  the  CD  and  have  concluded  that  Frau  Lee and  Herr  Sea  are  too  sick  for  this  facility,"  said  Chief   of Psychiatry, Dr.  Sy Cotic.      "I'd   mistakenly  thought  there   was hope for full recovery when they no longer insisted upon coming to meals with their gowns open in  the  front,  but  when  they  didn't respond to occupational therapy  and  got  on  this  joke  jag,  I  had to let them go.       We  simply  cannot  tolerate   patients   wasting valuable materials to make hand  buzzers  and  fake  barf,"  Dr.  Cotic continued.   Although  unavailable  for  comment,  "Lee  and  Sea   vehemently deny  having  made  the  CD  while  on  the  inside,"  an  unidentified spokesman said.     "Actually,  one  day  they  were  so  bored,   they escaped,  unnoticed,  and  ended-up  at  a  nearby   grange   hall   in Chimacum,  Washington  where  they  happened  upon  a  bunch  of  other former patients who  were  attempting  to  improvise  eco-based  comedy bits for Seattle area  radio  station,  KSER.  Trying  to  turn  topics as grim as acid rain dripping through  holes  in  the  ozone  into knee slapping comedy, appealed to the two depressives right  away. When Sea's old Radio Shack dictation  machine  caught  fire,"  the spokesman continued, "the other inmates fled.    But Lee  and  Sea stuck it out and deeply inhaled the toxic fumes which  became  the streams of acerbic exhalations that ultimately led  to  the  creation  of Mouthbreather.    With  no  hope  of  obtaining  corporate financing, the desperate pair pooled their disability  checks  and held hostage an innocent sound engineer who did an  award  winning job of mixing an entire album with the jagged edge of a broken  IV bottle at his throat.   The result  is  seventy-two  minutes  of incisive, synapse blistering humor.  Mouthbreather: Humor  for  the Totally Incorrect, Performed by the Puget Sound Bytes . On  CD  and Cassette.
