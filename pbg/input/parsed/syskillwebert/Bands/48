"Four stars out of three!"   - James Velvet,  WPLR Local Bands Show    "This highly proficient quartet... plays darn well!"   - Christopher Arnott,  New Haven Advocate      What the Cat Dragged In  is an  unsigned  and flat broke band of Yale graduate students.  Originally formed in late 1992, the band has played  numerous clubs in the New Haven area as well as the annual Summertime Street Festival. The band's instrumentation includes (but is not limited to) guitar, keyboards, bass and drums.   On Nov. 5, 1994, the band released its first full-length CD,  Scratch Tracks .  This entirely independent release was  co-produced with Jim Chapdelaine (Mr. Right).  The CD contains 12 tracks for a total running time of 54:02 and includes an 8 panel full-color insert with lyrics, pictures, and graphics.    Big Love  is the first track off the CD to receive air time.   All of us take turns at lead vocal which adds alot of variety to our music.  Additionally, we each come to the band from different musical  backgrounds, so our music moves through the entire spectrum of genres. The above song was chosen for distribution through IUMA because we feel it represents an intriguing combination of our musical interests.        Heather Nye : Keyboards, Percussion  Heather is a native of Vancouver, WA, a Duke alum, a fourth year   pharmacology major, and a first year med student.   She plays an Ensoniq KS-32 and a Yamaha DX-7. Her influences are jazz/pop oriented and include Bonnie Raitt, Maria McKee, David Wilcox, and David Sandborn.     Mark Cassano : Guitar  Mark is our resident guitar hero. He's a native of Danbury, CT and an NYU grad. Currently, he's finishing his degree in Economics while posing as a mild-mannered professor at Vassar.  He plays a Hamer Special (made back in the days when Hamer was still a designer in the company) and thinks Richard Thompson is the greatest guitar player  alive (but still listens to just about everything else.)        Marco Mazzi : Drums  Marco still lives in New London, CT, his hometown for life, and makes the hour long drive for practices, shows, and classes. An RPI grad, he's studying electrical engineering. Marco plays Slingerland drums, is a big time Marillion fan, and knows a few guys named Vinny.        John McEachen : Bass, Harmonica, Guitar  John hails from Woodbridge, VA and is also an electrical engineering major. A Notre Dame alum, he can consistently be found in front of the TV on Saturday afternoons.  John plays a 6-string Alembic Elan. A former member of the defunct bluegrass combo  Whistler's Brother , he has some pretty  hefty country/folk persuasions.
