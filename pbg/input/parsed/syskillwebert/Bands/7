ISIKOJAM was formed while Kirk Casey, Soul Maah, and Maanas Itene were backing various South African and reggae artists in the San Francisco Bay Area. Kirk brought keyboardist Jonathan Ridpath to the group, and after one night of playing that was it! "It felt as though we had been playing together for years."   ISIKOJAM combines many styles of music and fuses them together to produce music that is very groove oriented with distinct melodies.     BASS:   Simon (Soul) Maah from Cameroon played with EKAMBI Brilliant and Manu Dibango,  The Soul Makossa Man. Soul left Cameroon for Nigeria to play with  Jerry Cooper. He then embarked on a thirteen year recording and  producing career that took him to such world class studios as EMI,  DECCA, Phonodisk, RecordDisk, Satellite, and TABANSI. After touring  with Sonny Okusons for five years, Soul came to the United States  looking for new challenges.  Residing in the East Bay, Soul plays for  many international and local artists that make their way through the  Bay Area.     GUITARS:  Kirk Casey was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a young teenager his band  opened shows for The Grateful Dead, Santana, and The Sons Of Champlin.  Studying composition in college, Kirk then continued with Cuban  Classical guitar. Kirk's interest in world music and jazz lead him to  study music from many countries of the world. He then studied with  Miles Davis guitarist Dave Cramer. Currently, Kirk can be heard on  many national television commercials for such Fortune 500 companies as  Alamo Car rental, Toyota, GMC trucks, Buick,Yamaha motorcycles, and  the NBA. Kirk also tours internationally with Jamaican artists Della  Grant and The Twinkle Brothers.     DRUMS:  Maanas Itene hails from Nigeria, West Africa. It took Maanas three years to get to the United  States to seek his fortune as a respected musician. Upon arrival to  the United States the tour previously scheduled for the band was  canceled. Maanas found himself without work and stranded. He made his  way to the Bay Area, and now tours with KOTOJA, West African High Life  Band, and Inka Inka. Groups that Maanas has formerly played with in  Nigeria include Liberty Loverboy, Victor Suuku, Isaac Black, King  Walla Man, and Mandators.     KEYBOARDS:   Jonathan Ridpath has been playing for over thirty years. He studied at the Berklee School of  Music and the New England Conservatory. After his schooling, Jonathan  then toured along the East Coast, and has played at Tanglewood on  several occasions. Jonathan moved to San Francisco in 1976 and began  teaching classical piano. Jonathan recently released a solo EP, titled  Reflections.   For information about ISIKOJAM please contact:      ISIKOJAM MUSIC  P.O.
