    Bernard, Mary Ellen      Bernard, Mary Ellen                 Sugar Reef                           (Excerpt 148k, 222k / Full song 4 mins, 2.92M, 5.83M)          Folk ,   Humor ,   Pop                                          "Tom Waits meets Tracey Ullman."    "This crazy chick should turn VH-1 on its ear." --  The Music Paper       Mary Ellen Bernard  just doesn't know how to fit in. Her debut  recording   Point of Departure   was described by a New York radio  personality as "Tom Waits meets Tracey Ullman." (Huh?) See, it's not quite pop, not quite jazz, not quite blues, not quite folk -- and yet, a little of each. And some of it's kind of, well ... funny. What's a radio programmer to do? Well ... play it! And they have ... at WXPN in Philadelphia ... WGBH in Boston ... the "Z-100 Morning Zoo" in New York city ... KSER in Seattle... even Radio Riga in Latvia! (Yes, Latvia.) And listeners love it.   On Point of Departure Mary Ellen and producer Paul Guzzone are more musically extravagant than is currently feasible in her live shows. Here, the Patty Larkin song "Caffeine" is a full-fledged big-band number. Other tracks feature (live, not sampled) Brazilian percussion, horn sections, even bird calls. (Okay, the bird calls are sampled -- with permission, of course.) "We tried desperately to use every musician in New York," Mary Ellen says of the undertaking. "We didn't, but you still get your money's worth."   Mary Ellen has been playing live at such Northeast clubs as The Iron Horse Music Hall in Northampton, MA; The Godfrey Daniels in Bethlehem, PA; The Bitter End in New York city, The Towne Crier in Pawling, NY and other folk clubs, coffee houses, jazz & blues rooms, theaters and festivals. She's opened shows for Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, John Sebastian and Saffire: Uppity Blues Women.   Backed by keyboards and bass/acoustic guitar (and sometimes violin), her concerts center mostly on rootsy blues and jazz, bittersweet ballads and her signature "wacky production numbers." "Caffeine" has become one of these and so has the John Prine/Fred Koller collaboration "Let's Talk Dirty in Hawaiian." Recently some original tunes have entered this category as well. "My mission is to disprove the theory that no one ever laughs in a folk club," she states. "I'll be working on jazz clubs next."    Order NOW!     Point of Departure   featuring "Sugar Reef" is available on CD and cassette. Also available is the incredibly cool Mary Ellen Bernard T-Shirt!    Call FREE!
