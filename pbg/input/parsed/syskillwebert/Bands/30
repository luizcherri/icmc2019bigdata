We are  "The Angels of Venice,"  a trio of professional female musicians performing original music for harp, flute and cello in the romantic/neoclassical style.  Dressed completely in white, we have been told our appearance is as striking as the beauty and feeling our music imparts to our listeners.   We specialize in creating an enchanting atmosphere for special occasions, from small private parties to weddings to large media and world events, of which we have extensive experience.   We have had the collective experience of playing in symphonies and doing session work for movie studios, to performing at the World Cup-sponsored "Three Tenors" concert at Dodger Stadium. We were just recently invited to play at The Screen Actors Guild Awards Ceremony Dinner. Our cellist participated in Yanni's "World Tour 1995" performing in countries around the world. Members of our prior audiences include Tom Hanks, Bob Hope, Phyllis Diller, Ann-Margaret, Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Guns 'N Roses, and many others.   Our music evokes happiness and pure joy as well as introspection, self-reflection and contemplation of one's inner spiritual world. Our credo is:      "The Angels of Venice are Dedicated to Expressing Through Music the  Beauty and Mystery of the Human Spirit and Celebrating the Gift of  Life."          Our current release is entitled "The Angels of Venice - Music for Harp, Flute and Cello" and we have manufactured CDs and cassettes of this title. To date we have sold on our own over 5,000 recordings of this original music. We sell directly to customers and through mail order and our music has been circulated from Los Angeles to Russia. We currently have distribution agreements with several well-respected companies.   We are writing to announce our availability to you for performances.
