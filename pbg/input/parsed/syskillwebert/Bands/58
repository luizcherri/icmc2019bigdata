     God Dog                                                            Emission                           (Excerpt 120k, 180k / Full song 5 mins, 3.55M, 7.13M)          Hard-core/Industrial ,   Heavy Metal                                        	Heralded by such sources as the City Revolt Publication  and KSCU radio as one of the most original new acts to come out  in years,  God Dog is an Industrial  blend of  hard-edged  metal, synths, sampling and electronic effects.  Originating   from the Bay Area, which has provided a breeding ground for  several top-notch Industrial groups that have become major  forces in the international world of  music, God Dog is one of  the newer "Tech Metal" groups to burst upon the scene.    God Dog consists of  the electronic and vocal talents of  Steve  Severino and guitarist/programmer, Mike Vaughn. The two have  been working extensively since the fall of 1993 and have  released a full-length independent CD, "Of Love, Death and  Blood", as well as performing several live shows.  The self  professed goal of God Dog is to take the combination of metal  and electronic technology to areas yet to be explored. Their  sound takes this union and manipulates it in a way that is  innovative and exciting yet not experimental in terms of song  structure and melody.  God Dog will appeal to people who like  to hear Industrial music through a straight line rather than a  jagged tunnel.     With the addition of drummer, programmer and  synth master, Ben Padilla, God Dog are expanding their live  shows and adding a plethora of new sounds and styles to new  material while maintaining their Industrial edge.  Emphasis on  diversity and quality, a commitment to integrity, a  concentrated effort toward constant productivity and a growing  loyal fan base mean God Dog will be around for years to come.
