    Porter, JL      Porter, JL                 Nothing But Magic                           (Excerpt 160k, 240k / Full song 2.5 mins, 1.70M, 3.41M)          Pop ,   Rock                           J. L. Porter     J. L. Porter 's California is Central Valley tule fog on I-5, grunion runs on Windansea beach in La Jolla, rows of Bart Simpson banks on Tijuana's main drag. It's a world of weekend road trips, beach parties, and college football games. And, it's where love and innocence are found, and lost, and found again, someplace between a margarita and a forgotten Elvis movie.          Porter's debut CD,  Viva La Revolucion!  (on independent label Permanent Records Del Mar), covers all these bases and more. The 12 songs, performed by Porter (on his trusty Vox Wildcat guitar) and drummer  Brendan Kremer , feature stripped-down arrangements and a light, rockabilly feel. This disc is produced by Porter and fellow San Diego singer/songwriter "Famous" Steve Denyes.      Viva La Revolucion! has been lauded not only by San Diego's music press, but also in the pages of Nashville-based national magazine  Performing Songrwriter . Porter is a regular performer at San Diego's coffeehouses and bars.      Contact Porter via Permanent Records Del Mar's voice-mail at 619/454-1627; or by email at jlporter@cts.com.
