We are a neo-retro  band, playing both original music and covers. The song loaded onto  the Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA) is "Get Even More,"  our personal advice for when things go bad: Don't get mad, don't  get even, get even more!   Deth Specula was formed by the crafty Malcom McCameron a couple of  years ago, and was an immediate hit with some of the band's friends.  Deth Specula is:       Kozmo  - rhythm guitar, vocals   Malcom McCameron  - lead guitar, management   Tim E Rotarian (aka Timmy, aka Timmer)  - lead vocals   RaSTrO!  - drums   Yam  - bass, vocals   Immediately after forming the band, Malcom booked the group on a series  of World Tours. It seemed like a good idea at the time.  However,  by sheer coincidence, every single gig they tried to play, such as  Kuwait City in January of 1991, or Clarke Air Force Base in the Philippines,  was canceled due to some kind of natural or human-caused disaster.  Recently, Malcom vainly tried to put together a Yugoslavia Cease-Fire  Tour following the latest United Nations declarations, but again war intervened and the tour was cancelled.   Because of the Yugoslavia Cease-Fire Tour debacle, Deth Specula has  many concert t-shirts left over, most of which are stored in Malcom's  dad's garage. For information on buying a t-shirt or other Specula  paraphernalia (buttons, bumper stickers), send e-mail to:    specula@deth.com    Ask to be subscribed to our monthly, on-line fanzine. New subscribers  get a free bumper sticker and a couple of buttons, and we'll send you  prices and other information.   A Tape? Yeah, we're making one. Trust me. It's going to have six original  songs on it, and we're recording it in January of 1994. We'll let everyone  know when it's available via our on-line fanzine.   Finally, we are putting together an Internet World-wide Web (WWW) home  page that will have more Specula info - maybe even some video clips. Again,  subscribe to the fanzine by mailing specula@deth.com and we'll keep you  posted on events.   We hope to see your smiling e-mail in our mailboxes and your smiling faces  at our shows.   Thanks ...      Malcom McCameron    PHOTO CREDIT: Sharky takes our promo pictures.   Take a trip to the deth zone-- the  Deth Specula Home Page .       ABOUT THE DEMO SONG  Get Even More :    Get Even More  is for anyone who gets screwed over by Fate, The System, a lover, your boss, or whatever. We have always considered it a special song because members of Deth Specula, many of our fans, and close friends lost their jobs over the  last couple of years.   The song was recorded at the drummer's house on a Tascam 8-track  cassette. Vocals (Timmy, Yam and Kozmo) were recorded on the back  porch and the guitars (Malcom and Kozmo) were recorded in the bathroom.  Drums (RaStRo!) were recorded in the bedroom and the bass (Yam) was direct. Although it was mastered on cassette (oh joy), the  end result is not too shabby. However, we can't wait to rerecord this  in a studio.   Engineering was handled by Eric "Sharky" Davis, the Mystery Sixth Member of the band. Sharky takes care of our live sound, much of our recording, camera work, and general technical stuff. We couldn't have done it without him.    Get Even More  is one of our most popular live songs (along with our cover of "Radar Love" and our original "(I'm in Love with a)  Gutterslut." We play it just as well live as on tape, in case you were wondering. :-)     by Robert Lord of the IUMA staff                        December 29, 1993     I Wanna Be Updated  is Deth Specula's bonus song for the IUMA. It's a spoof on the Ramones song  I Wanna Be Sedated  to reflect what it's like to working for a software company. Here'some lyrics for example:      Twenty, twenty, twenty-four hours to go,      I wanna be updated.    Nothing to do, nowhere to go,      I wanna be updated.     Get me to the trade show,      put me on a plane.    Send it to me Fed Ex,    before I go insane.    I can't control my budget,    can't drink away the pain,    Oh no no no no!      These guys are a tight rock band and this song rules. Check it out.    -robertLord, IUMA staff.
