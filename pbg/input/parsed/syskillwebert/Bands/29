    Challenge      Challenge                 Soul Sirens                           (Excerpt 120k, 180k / Full song 4.2 mins, 3.05M, 6.10M)          Rock                                     With the release of their self-titled debut album, on Splash International Records,  Challenge  proves to be a natural to shape melodic rock of today. The CD is packed with emotion laden vocals, catchy guitars and most of all, memorable songs.    Challenge  is  Arno Verstappen  on guitar and  Allison Lindsay  on vocals. With the help of fellow musicians and friends, who appear on this first offering, this duo is a force to be reckoned with.   Arno emphasizes that their goal is to make music which is less fad oriented.  "People have a hard time classifying our music because it's melodic, yet modern.  Lately people seem to think that in order to be current, music has to be alternative or grunge. It's interesting, then, to note the current popularity of numerous melodic and classic rock bands. Since their songs have a timeless nature, they haven't had to jump on any trends to enjoy continued success. A position we want to be in.   While few female singers have had long lasting, enduring careers, Allison feels the tide is turning, "Artists like Melissa Etheridge and Bonnie Raitt are paving the way for women with strong melodies and honest emotional vocals. It's time for us to cut out the gimmicks and get back to strong vocal lines and great songs."   The two first met in Hollywood in 1991, when Amo was auditioning to find the singer that could bring life to his music. Originally from Holland, Arno came to Los Angeles in 1989 to study at GIT (Guitar Institute of Technology). After graduation, he decided to stay in town to form a band. "There are a lot more opportunities in Los Angeles. In Holland, the rock scene is very small," Arno clarifies. "Few bands from there, with the notable exception of Golden Earring (who have been a great inspiration), are able to make a comfortable living out of playing music."   Coming from opposite sides of the Atlantic exposed the two musicians to different styles of music. How does that influence the band? "Arno grew up listening to the great European rock guitarists. Guys with lots of feel and personality," explains Allison. "My influence has come from the dynamics of American singers. You could say we are now able to incorporate the best of both worlds into our own music."   As for lyrical content, the band touches on matters of the heart as well as more serious topics. Allison elaborates, "Everyone can find themselves in a love song but we also like to address other matters that inspire and concern us. Such as the ups and downs that present themselves in everyday life. "   Next to being the voice for  Challenge , Allison is gaining notoriety by teaching at Sabine Institute (for Vocal Strengthening and Development) in Los Angeles.  Sabine Institute (established by renowned vocal coach Elizabeth Sabine) is famous for coaching many of rocks brightest stars including Axl Rose, Dave Mustaine, Brian Howe (Bad Co.). The Institute is currently branching out by bringing it's powerful technique to Japan, Australia and Italy.   The band has every reason to be confident about the road ahead. "We know the time is right for us," stresses Amo. "Alternative and grunge have clearly textured the 90's with their realistic depictions of the life styles of today's youth.  However, history shows us that music trends tend to move in waves and Challenge will be on the crest of the rising tide of new melodic rock."

Challenge has a sound all its own - a blend of power pop and progressive rock with harder undercurrents running throughout."  -- R. Sayegh,  SCREAMER  (January 1994)  "Allison is one of vbery few singers that intuitively knows how to merge passion and technical ability. Besides being an incredible singer, Allison is also a highly acclaimed teacher at the institute."   -- Elizabeth Sabine,  Founder of Sabine Institute and vocal coach to the stars (i.e. Axl Rose, Dave Mustaine).
