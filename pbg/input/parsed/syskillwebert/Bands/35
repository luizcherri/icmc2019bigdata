    Crosswind                Fairytales                           (Excerpt 160k, 240k / Full song 3:42 mins, 2.67M, 5.33M)          Rock                                                    After years of experience and dedication this swirling musical mass known as  Crosswind  now surges to gale force. Fed by an encouraging musical climate and drawing from potent wells of knowledge and ability, Crosswind has developed into a serious storm of sound and fury, ready to establish sovereignty. Quickly take this opportunity to examine the conditions and prevailing atmospheric circumstances that have merged and intersected to proudly produce Crosswind.   First there were simple honest goals which were almost always the truest direction to take. Often it takes a band or any collection of musicians a long time to arrive at that realization. Some never reach such a lofty level of understanding, but wallow hopelessly lost in bandwagon jumping, trend-observing confusion. Crosswind, however, is an example of a band whose members have come nearly full circle in development and found themselves staring squarely at the musical bottom line-- go with what you know!!   Diligently working thir way through ideas,expectations, views and objectives, often by way of countless "hell gigs" - the members of this bluesy guitar-driven rock ensemble: vocalist  Dana Hall , guitarist  Scottie Jordan , bass player  Rich Barefoot  and drummer  Dan Ross ; have been savvy enough to grasp the concept that experience, a good work ethic and a straightforward stand is often the only way to rock and roll heaven. Sadly, today, the industry weather report frequently features bands that are here today, gone later today Not Crosswind!   The band has gathered strength around a brooding, talented and misleading calm eye - lead vocalist Dana Hall. She is the focal center of the Crosswind storm. She and her compatriots know that while success would be wonderful, being good, really good, offers the greater reward. Thus, the die was cast, their lot thrown together.   Crosswind was originally born out of the demise of several other Charlotte, N.C.-area bands. "We were scared," Dana admits, "we had to start over from scratch. Now, we've done a lot of road work, that has helped me to understand the idea of entertainment. Now it feels so good to be up there singing for other people, not for me -- but for everybody out there!"   With well over 300 gigs under their belt, Crosswind has established a solid live show and appeared alongside major regional and national acts (yes, some of these bands are still around!) such as: .38 Special, Mothers Finest, Kansas, Nightranger, The Outlaws, Steppenwolf, Copperhead, Molly Hatchet, Three Dog Night, The Georgia Satellites and Cry of Love.   Calling Crosswind a "Southern-fried version of The Who" Jordan believes that the availability of the bands music is a big part of the success equation. To fulfill that requirement, Crosswind recorded nine original songs on a cassette album entitled "Can You Feel It?" that they plan to distribute "everywhere possible".  Recorded at White Room Studios in Charlotte, the new music on "Can You Feel It?" is a real representation of the soul of Crosswind."Our sound is simple", says Hall. "We write what we feel, not what we think we're expected to write." Calling the band's sound a mixture of Southern rock, anthem rock, the blues and hard rock, she adds "This band has lots of energy. We pour it out onto the audiences in much the same fashion as a lot of 70's bands. We feed off the crowd and in return the crowd feeds off us."    PRESS REVIEWS     Their better original stuff leans toward moody Led Zeppelin and raucous Aerosmith and steers clear of wimpy Journey-isms. Dana Hall has a strong rock n' roll voice, and they avoid the pretentious, ridiculous, stage-strutting monkeyshines of so many hard rockers.   -  Charlotte Observer , September 25 1993    Crosswind delivers straight ahead rock n' roll as subtly as a slap in the face. A listen to the band's cassette "Can You Feel It?" proves us right. We felt it.   -  Asheville Citizen-Times , January 13, 1995    This Charlotte outfit mixes some solid guitar crunch, an attitude that's aggressive without being threatening and the pipes of CL Best of Charlottes Best Female Vocalist winner Dana Hall.   -  Creative Loafing  February 1994       " Can You Feel It? " 9-song cassette of high energy, sultry, hard rockin', bluesy, funky, southern kinda soundin thang with a bad female set of pipes up front!!!
