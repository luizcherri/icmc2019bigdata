Biographical Information:    In 1984 Lois LaFond had two of the most gorgeous, talented and astounding Children on the face of the earth, who were four and five years old.  She searched high and low, in and out, up and down, by and through, far and wide, but couldn't find the kind of music she really liked made especially for Children (like smokin' saxophones and percolatin'percussion). So, being one to do whatever was necessary for those two most gorgeous, talented and astounding Children on the face of the earth, she decided to put out an album of her own with Reggae, Salsa, Blues,Ballads, Rock & Roll and African grooves. As she had been in the adult music scene for some number of years in the Boulder-Denver area, she had access to some of the greatest musicians to be found anywhere. And, as it worked out, in 1985, she had her third baby: I AM WHO I AM! This recording put her on the map as one of the premier American artists making modern music for young Children. At the same time she gathered four of Colorado's really rockin' players and formed LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES -- one of the early five-piece bands to hit the road for Kids.   Now this World Beat sound satisfied those two gorgeous, talented and astounding Children, who also composed many of the songs with LaFond. Soon LaFond found out that many other Children-- as well as their parents -- were absolutely thrilled with her recording. People said things like, "I really don't mind that my Child plays this tape over and over and over and over and over and over. I really like it, too!" Reviews poured in from all over the country from newspapers and magazines, parents and teachers, and -- most importantly -- from Kids. I AM WHO I AM! became a signature tune which put LaFond in the forefront of composing and producing songs of self-esteem and diversity -- years before they were the buzzwords of today. Classrooms started using the music, as did Spinabifida Centers, ARC Centers and Very Special Arts Festivals around the country.   Encouraged by the response, LaFond decided to make another record in 1986. And another one in 1987. And another one in 1989. Each recording brought more rave reviews, positive comments and responses from publications like THE L.A.PARENT, PARENTS' CHOICE, BILLBOARD MAGAZINE, DOWNBEAT MAGAZINE, GRAMMY MAGAZINE, American Library Association's BOOKLIST, PRE-K TODAY, MUSIC EDUCATOR'S JOURNAL, SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL,  Jill Jarnow's ALL EARS, Laurie Sale's GROWING UP WITH MUSIC .. . . In fact, there were so  many reviews that there was no way to keep track of them anymore!   LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES' songs were played on RADIO AAHS, WE LIKE KIDS of KTOO, Alaska,  PICKLEBERRY PIE out of Santa Cruz, WCBS-TV in New York, and on CONTINENTAL,LUFTHANSA, and DELTA Airlines Children's in-flight programming.   Of course, people started calling for shows with the ROCKADILES. So they toured their original  participatory concerts to thousands of Children from New York to Oregon and from                          Alaska to Florida at places like New York's CENTRAL PARK, HENRY STREET SETTLEMENT, and ST.PETER'S  CATHEDRAL.   Then, in 1995, LaFond produced her fifth album, TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN. So now the Rockin'  ROCKADILES' concerts include songs from this new recording as well as I AM WHO I AM! and their very popular ONE WORLD.   Soon LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES will be touring throughout COLORADO and in CHICAGO,  NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, and WASHINGTON, D.C. If you are in these areas, they might just be able to come to your community. You can call HEATHER NOTO at AGENCY WEST (303-652-3421) to bring ROCKADILES to YOUR town -- wherever you are!!   One thing Lois LaFond knows for sure is that every Child she gets to meet now is gorgeous, talented and astounding.

I just started thinking of the craziest combinations of words that started with the same letter. I like to pass on to kids some of what are called "figures of speech" in the English language, and this one is always a lot of fun. You can make up your own alliterations -- try any letter.   "One World" originated as a song for adult audiences. Its groove has an mbaganga influence from South Africa, also called "township jive." When recording my Children's album, I thought "One World" would be a great choice to include for kids since it always got a such a hearty response from dancing adults. I try not to do any less for kids than I do for adults.      Press Reviews      About TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN (song included online):     P.J.
