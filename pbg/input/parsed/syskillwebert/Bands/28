Penelope was heralded as the "archetypal indomitable rock 'n'  roll woman and her band dubbed "a major national musical asset"  by  The New Touser Press Record Guide .   Time matured her music; hard-edged noise became intricate melody,  and raw anger became transformed into a bittersweet awareness  of the human condition. Penelope was drawn to the evocative and  immediate nature of acoustic instruments. In expanding the  dimensions of her core sound, she added bandoneon, cello,  accordion, soprano and bass clarinet, cornet, French horn,  melodica and autoharp. Her work has evolved in  terms of intimacy and depth of emotion, but she has lost none of  the fierce intelligence that powered the music of the Avengers.
