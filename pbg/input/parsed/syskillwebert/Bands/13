All instruments and vocals performed, produced, and composed by Pattrex. Copyright 1995 Pattrex.  Email at "pattrex@npixi.com".    Pattrex performs with a 4 piece backing band occasionally. They are loud (like a jet taking off at a distance of 10 feet), so bring ear protection when you see them. Yes, Pattrex is a vegetarian but that doesn't mean he is a "nice mellow kind of guy". Hemorrhaging at concerts is not a fun thing. Protect your ears. Always.    The idea behind Pattrex is to create exciting experiences utilizing available technology. Pattrex is part of an emerging convergence of these tools. The song you'll be listening to is a midtempo type pop thing.  Kinda sounds like a cross between Smashing Pumpkins and Peter Gabriel. And then some.  The music is real.

This should be up and running by May 1995     Most of what you are hearing was created and recorded digitally. The studio this was recorded in is a tiny back room at Empty Street in Atlanta, GA. Most of the studio lives in a Macintosh IIvx computer with a 1.2 GB Hard Disk and Opcode's StudioVision sequencer/digital recorder. Pattrex used inexpensive and readily-available hardware and software for this effort. Mackie mixers were used, and Alesis effects devices. I recommend these brands pretty highly. Tannoy speakers (PBM 6.5s). Also, a basic Tascam 488 cassette 8 track was used to slave in some additional tracks. Pretty simple stuff, actually.  The only semi-expensive element was an AKG C414 microphone I rented for a day for $10 from Private Studios in Champaign Illinois (thanks Jon! PS: call up and harass Jon at (217) 367-3530). Oh, yeah- a cool 12 string electric guitar was borrowed from CV LLoyde's in Champaign (call (217) 352-7031 to harass Gary and CV and order stuff).    But that's not all...   Pattrex has several multimedia demos available on-line through the internet and on services such as America Online and Compuserve. One of these, the first Macintosh-created music industry promo clip available on the Internet, is called "pats music video" and is available via anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu under directory /info-mac/grf/qt. Pattrex also has appeared on the Internet "musenet" 1992 compilation CD with the song "There's Love Here Today", and on the 10th AMUG CDROM compilation BBS-In-A-Box (available through the Arizona Macintosh Users Group). Pattrex is a founding member of the renegade multimedia group "NPiX InterActive", and creates freelance multimedia for the entertainment industry in his spare time.     Pattrex is a member of IICS (International Interactive Computing Society), ASCAP, and an Apple Associate Developer and MultiMedia Program member. Pattrex is also part of  NPiX Interactive .    You *might* be able to reach Pattrex at (404) US-FOLKS. Maybe. That machine is pretty flaky, though. Email is best. Or voice mail us at (404) 892-1971.    Critics say:   "Hot, Hot, Hot. It sure is f*cking hot out today, why the hell don't you get air conditioning huh?"         - Gary Strater of the band StarCastle  formerly on Epic Records (check out StarCastle's upcoming album!)    "I hope you know your rent is past due. Again."         - Donald Mead, Landlord  (PS: send don email at dmm@prism.gatech.edu if you think he should cut me some slack. Thanks!)    "Hey babe, get used to it"         - Meghan Neely , drunk groupie from Mocksville, North Carolina (Stay away from Meghan. Trust me).    "Thank you for your submission. Even though we called you and asked for a copy of your EP, we have no intention of listening to it. Actually, unless you are my boss's kid sister or are willing to sleep with my German Shepherd I don't think I will even return your calls.  Pretty funny, huh? How's THAT grab you buddy?"         - Anonymous (ex)Major Label executive  from a company on Sunset in L.A.      "It is loud and bothered me. It made my liver hurt. And I had to go to the bathroom all the time."         - Man describing ultrasonic procedure for removing kidney stones    "Wow. Pat is melodic and urgent, and I am reminded of a young Bryan Adams."        -Rolling Stone Magazine (yeah, it's true but I don't know how to take that...)
