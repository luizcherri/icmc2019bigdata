With roots grounded in a solid classical music background, Ms. Markay has worked with some of the top names in the industry, ranging trom Quincy Jones and Eric Clapton, to Carly Simon and George Duke. Her credits have also been splashed across Michael Jackson's "BAD" video, directed by Martin Scorsese, and on the Saturday Night Live band through Leon Pendarvis - the band's keyboard player with whom she worked.   Ms. Markay started out by winning a scholarship to New York's prestigious Juilliard School of Music where she studied composition with Roger Sessions and developed into an outstanding classical pianist. But despite her exceptional ability as a classical musician, she could not be confined to that genre. While still wearing pigtails and braces on her teeth, Ms. Markay was called on to showcase her prodigious talents to the European community as part of a popular college rock and roll tour sponsored by a couple of Britain's better known producers. She met the challenge    by performing to standing ovations on many European campuses.  Upon arrival back to the United States, she was invited to perform in her own Miami Beach rock and roll review. She quickly followed that success with a dance music hit, "It's Allrite," (released on WEA International in Holland). The tune wowed audiences in clubs all across the United States, and romped up the international music charts reaching an enviable No. 19 in Holland. That achievement was soon overshadowed by "I Don't Wanna Be A Zombie," which zoomed to No. 2 on the French music charts, and demonstrated beyond a doubt that "It's Allrite" was no musical fluke.   In between these many successes Ms. Markay further demonstrated her multi-faceted musical talents with solid credits in live performances, record dates, voice-overs, background vocals, and jingles for which she was in great demand in New York City where she lived and worked until moving to the West Coast two years ago. Ms. Markay recently completed her latest album, "Change To Come" which she composed, arranged and produced, and on which she is also the lead vocalist and plays a number of musical instruments. The album features a dazzling array of background musicians, and has been getting rave reviews trom a number of well-respected music critics.
