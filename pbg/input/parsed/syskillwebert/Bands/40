Singer, songwriter, arranger and performer,  Eve B. , has been performing in the Boston area since 1990 when she formed and fronted the band, Eve'n Up. The band played Eve's original tunes in Boston clubs for three years headlining and opening for other area locals before Eve decided to go solo in 1993.   Eve's musical past also includes the recording of a single on an independent European label in 1988, tours of Japan and France in 1988 and 1989, and more recently, performances with The Berklee College of Music Gospel Choir as a soloist in 1993.   Among Eve's various musical projects are several self-produced demos. The most recent, a four-song CD entitled, Innocence, is the culmination of her performing and songwriting experience. The four songs on the CD were written, produced and arranged by Eve B. with assistance from songwriter/ guitarist, Andrea Bensmiller, who previously performed in the Boston acoustic scene. Eve and Andrea merged their talents in 1994 to form EB Productions and have since continued to write, arrange and produce together.        The four tracks included on Innocence are "Sexy Thing", "Innocence", "Invitation", and "Field of Hope". Each tune showcases Eve's soulful, sultry, and purely original vocal style. Eve's creative and tasteful integration of vocal riffs and runs makes each tune breathe with soul and originality. The songs can best be described as a blend of pop and R&B with a strong gospel influence. Arrangements are characterized by the complex interweaving of keyboards and guitars, and lush harmonic backing vocals.
