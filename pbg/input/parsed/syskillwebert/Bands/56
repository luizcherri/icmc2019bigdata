    Wallace, Dorothy      Wallace, Dorothy                 Automo Joe                           (Excerpt 135k, 203k / Full song 5.5 mins, 3.96M, 7.93M)          Rock                                            I consider myself a singer/songwriter. I don't like to define my style because I have always felt that was someone else's job. I like to write about things I feel passionate about and communicate my feelings through songwriting. I think my music is unique because although I'd like a career in music, that is not my motivation. Making music is very spiritual and songs are like prayers for me. My songs are always analytical, sometimes topical and occasionally political because I want the listeners to get emotional about, think about or get angry about a subject they were previously unfamiliar with. I think a good song can get under your skin and bring up emotions you never knew were there.        Band member list:       Although I'm a solo artist, I've had the privilege of working with very talented musicians:   Automo Joe  (Tribute to Jimi Hendrix)  : written and produced by Dorothy Wallace     John Petrucci  -  Guitar:  When my original guitar player cancelled an hour before this session, I called Focus II Guitar Center in Commack, Long Island to see if they knew a guitar player who was a Hendrix fan, so they sent me one of their teachers, John Petrucci. Now he's doing real well with his progressive Metal band "Dream Theater" (East West Records). Their latest album "Awake" blows Megadeth right out the window! One guitar magazine called him the "Guitar Hero of the Nineties"!. Lucky Me! He played on my song!!     Dave Ambrosio  -  Bass:  A very talented virtuoso musician. Dave has a degree in composition from Manhattan School of Music and is playing with a Jazz band in Manhattan. He can also play keyboards and has played guitar on some of my songwriting demos.     Paul Presseau  -  Drums:  Another virtuoso musician. He can also play piano and guitar and writes beautiful lyrics. He likes to travel and study music of different cultures.      America   written and produced by Dorothy Wallace       Paul Presseau   - Drums     Dave Ambrosio   - Bass     Pat Ambrosio   - Guitar: Dave's brother. I don't know him but he was nice. (even though he cancelled his Automo Joe session)      Contact Information    Dorothy Wallace  6515 Boulevard East  Apt. 2L  West New York, NJ 07093-4207  (201)662-1104         Brief description of song:     Automo Joe:    A tribute to Jimi Hendrix. The idea was to make my voice not only sing the lyrics but also sound like a guitar. Then for the guitar to tell the rest of the story when I stopped singing the lyrics. I'm very proud of this production because it's the first record I produced that sounds exactly the way I wanted it to sound. I also incorporated elements of "Hey Joe" and other Hendrix riffs into this song.    America:    I wanted this to sound like it's coming from the point of view of a Native American which is why I used tribal drum sounds. This is combined with military marching band sounds because the song is about how greed, power and the desire for world domination can destroy a beautiful country. The intro and outro are excerpts of Gospel singer Marion Williams' "They Lead my Lord Away".

America:    An urgent, soaring, thunderous challenge to recapture a nation's lost direction. Dorothy's music has a definite '60s influence, but rather than borrowing old riffs, she revives the soul, daring and defiant spirit particular to that era.
