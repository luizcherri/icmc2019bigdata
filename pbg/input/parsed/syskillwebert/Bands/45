No Winter was born in the Fall of 1979 in Aptos, California as a quartet. After stormy beginnings,  the dust cleared and a tight, enduring trio (Robert, Jim and Dave) emerged called AURORA BOREALIS.  Early original music had wide influences and took shape in arrangements which balanced song with intricate  instrumental passages. As the band began to perform, numerous cover tunes crossing most musical  boundaries (From Alabamas to Zeppelins) were added to the repertoire. This helped to keep a ride range  of rooms filled, dancing, happy and intact. Always between the covers lurked the original songs.    Throughout the years the band evolved, mutated, went into oblivion and returned from oblivion, leading to the current project - an eight song CD/Cassette. This was produced with two living in Northern  California and the other in Southern California. Three of these songs are showcased here and the others  are: 													  Haven't I Cried Enough  							  Queen of the Rodeo     In Heaven    I need some Lovin'    Message to the stars    No Winter perpetually looks for musical/recording/exposure/performance opportunities.
