Chester Pike  Norwood, PA 19074     You let me down so gently  So carefully, so slow  I almost didn't get it  I almost didn't know  And when I finally understood  I almost didn't cry  It almost hurt me  When you said good-bye  'Cause you let me down so gently  "Cause you let me down so gently   You didn't need to worry  I'd do anything for you  I would have suffered long and hard  If you asked me to  But you let me down so gently   It's not your fault  You never meant me harm  You didn't know that I would find such rapture in your arms  It's not my fault  To fall in love with someone  Who would be so kind to me  And let me down so gently  You let me down so gently
