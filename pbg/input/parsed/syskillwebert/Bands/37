    nada      nada                 XLR Flood OD                           (Excerpt 122k, 122k / Full song 5.5 mins, 3.85M, 7.71M)          Experimental ,   Instrumental ,   Hard-core/Industrial                               nada   awkward y borracho core del todo       nada combines heavy beats, cynical lyrics and unearthly sounds with intricate percussion and intense guitar work to create a new listening experience.     'awkward y borracho core del todo' , nada's premiere release, opens with eerie samples, deep kick drum and a noisey guitar crescendo in "apopolysp." The fast guitar and techno schizophrenia of "x/l/r flood o.d." then collapses into the mystical wanderings of "ignatio chloride the balding." "the revolutionary om" uses ambient soundscapes to slowly build into an explosive ending. The grinding guitars and scraping metal percussion of "idiot's planet" lead into the hallucinogenic crawl of "tsunami fungus." "excruciate" combines a thumping subsonic kick with extensive guitar work, while the sinuous bass and drum sounds of "string (premonition v)" blend together for a more Eastern flavor. "afraid" winds through tribal rhythms and crunchy guitars featuring a strange vocal melody which by the end sets the mood for "near." "zoviet-amerikka" closes the CD with a hip-hop and funk rampage that fades into a classical ode to the decay of the U.S.A.    "nada is the product of years of frustrated attempts to create a distinctive band in the San Jose Area," said Robert M. Riddle IV. After playing with  Autumn Cathedral , Riddle formed  Swivelfaust  and  Slur  before the decision to start nada as a solo project. Riddle enlisted the talents of other musicians, including Scott Martinez (Autumn Cathedral), Damien Gonzalez (Swivelfaust, Slur) and Mason Jones (Trance).  The album was recorded at House of Faith in Palo Alto by Bart Thurber and produced by nada and Mason Jones. "This is the most satisfying mix of electronic, experimental, psychedelic and rock music that I have been able to create so far."    Nada uses influences as diverse as tribal drumming, techno sampling, hip-hop rhythms, wailing guitar and experimental noise to come up with a rich audio tapestry that is reminiscent of music by  Coil ,  The Legendary Pink Dots  and  Savage Republic  that should appeal most listening tastes.
