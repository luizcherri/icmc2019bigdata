    Manning, Barbara      Manning, Barbara                 Smoking Her Wings                           (Excerpt 32k, 126k / Full song 3.8 mins, 2.83M, 3.76M)          Pop ,   Rock ,   Folk                            Barbara Manning   The  Village Voice  said "Manning's songs are brooding,  unflinching, scary, and most utterly believable.... Lou Reed and  Rosanne Cash rolled into one."  Spin  magazine called Barbara's first album   Scissors   one of the best albums of the  decade. In the  Gavin  Report , musician Robyn Hitchcock named    Scissors   one of his top ten  favorites along with albums by Roxy Music, REM, Richard Thompson, and Elvis Costello. The  Village Voice  said "Barbara Manning can make waves in a sea of sarcasm with introspective pretty songs about heavy shit. Her voice makes the edge seem like a place to warm yourself....her Nick Drake dread was cut with punk derision, her Suzanne Vega lilt was frosted with anxiety and her folky ear was  full of Wire and the Fall."     Scissors  , originally released in 1988 on vinyl, was out of print for several years. As a special bonus, the CD and cassette formats of   One Perfect Green Blanket   includes all ten cuts  from the   Scissors   LP as well. Guest musicians helping out on the album include Kim  Osterwalder from Flophouse on cello, Melanie Clarin from Harm Farm on drums, and Steve Michner from Big Dipper on bass. Barbara has developed a strong cult following over the past several years with  her frequent live shows on both coasts. Barabara's music is regularly heard on college radio across the country. Several cuts from One    Perfect Green Blanket   were included in the underground film classic  Hippie Porn .
