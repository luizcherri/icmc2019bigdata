    Andrews, Jim                Doppelwerk                           (Excerpt 166k, 249k / Full song 5 mins, 3.59M, 7.18M)          Instrumental ,   Easy Listening                                        Jim Andrews      Jim is a native of Charlotte, North Carolina, and moved to Nashville in 1982 to attend Belmont College where he graduated with a Bachelors degree in Music Business in 1985.  Having performed various types of Music, he then began to record solo acoustic guitar pieces which were compiled for his first release "Storytale" in 1988.     While searching for a new and unique medium, Jim began composing music for Doppelgitarre (a type of German harp guitar) in 1989.  Having been introduced to engineer/producer Howard Toole in 1989, the two decided to co-produce an album.  "Music For Doppelgitarre" was released in 1990.  Jim performed in various places in Tennessee, then moved back to Charlotte in 1991.  Since that time, Jim has been performing in various venues in the southeast, as well as composing instrumental music for the forthcoming release "Pure White Monday" and guitar/vocal music for his performances and future recordings.     "Music for Doppelgitarre" is a collection of ten solo doppelgitarre pieces.  The music is very melodic in structure, and intended to convey a sense of serenity, color, and warmth.  As stated in a review by Guitar Player magazine, "perfect for a morning cup of Java or an evening of quiet solitude."  "Pure White Monday", however,  is more diverse containing different musical styles including pieces for guitar,  doppelgitarre, guitar synthesizer, and piano.  Jim's vocal music is rather like "introspective folk", with lyrics to "live by" and both flowing and aggressive guitar phrases.

Songs included on IUMA       "Momentum"   from "Music for Doppelgitarre"        The mood for this piece is described by its title.  It contains intricate phrases with harp string melodies mixed with quick guitar picking.  The melody, as always, is evident as it strikes the contemplative side of the listener.       "Serenity"  -  a live guitar/vocal recording        The title is somewhat ironic, as this is one of the more aggressive pieces.  It represents a good example of the diversity found in one of Jim's performances.      "Doppelwerk"   from "Pure White Monday"        This piece contains contrasting phrases from the doppelgitarre and piano.  The movement continues a steady pace throughout the song, and the song was titled "Doppelwerk" as it sounds like a more melodic, acoustic version of a well known German techno band.
