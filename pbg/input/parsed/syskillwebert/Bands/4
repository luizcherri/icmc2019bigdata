He has an independent label/publishing company called Gray Area which has several cool things for you to buy.  He also has a cool band called the Shellhead Mutants for you to come and see.  He also has an overwhelming desire to kill but it is controlled through medication.  what we sell:  "SPLEEN"  After toiling for a decade on the fringes, Dr. Octojoculus (aka Gary Gray) steps forward with his first CD release.  "SPLEEN" finds him showing yet another side of his schizophrenic musical personality with a sound that is slick yet bent.  The monstrous "MO FAT" anchors 12 songs of big beats and heavy guitars, twisted samples and half baked harangues.  We like it--if you know what's good for you, you will too.  lp cassette/cd.
