Mixed by Grammy award-winning songwriter and producer  Randy Sharp, everyone who appears on this album is an accomplished artist in their own right. Vocal production is by Rosemary Butler (Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt,  Jackson Browne, etc. ) , who also lends her legendary talents as backup vocalist, along with Arnold McCuller (Phil Collins, James Taylor, K.T. Oslin, etc.) and Linda Tillery (Bobby McFerrin, Linda Ronstadt).  Mike  Finnigan is heard on organ (Rolling Stones, Crosby, Stills & Nash, etc.), Andrew Woolfolk on saxes (Earth, Wind and Fire, Phil Collins), and Debra Dobkin (Bonnie Raitt) on percussion.  Don Kirkpatrick (Richard Marx, Amy Grant, etc.) blazes new flight paths with his amazing guitar work.  All remaining  keyboard work, as well as all of the basswork, is handled by Ms. Lindsay with her trademark grace and style (" Best Bass Player ",   Reader's Choice Awards, Hot Wire magazine).  Together, these artists combine to weave a tapestry of sheer elegance.   Diane Lindsay's performing and recording credits (over 25 albums) include Dusty Springfield, The Limeliters, Randy Sharp, Holly Near, Cris Williamson, Linda Tillery,  Ferron and many more, as well as BAM Magazine and NAIRD awards as a producer.  Her songs have been recorded by many  artists, received awards from both the Billboard Song Contest and the  Music City Song Festival, and are featured on stage, radio, film and  television.             Diane Lindsay's songs brave the deepest and most vulnerable of human  experiences with a  telescopic eye for the truth.  But her unusual  range also visits the fun and sensuous with equal committment.   "In my writing, playing and arrangements, I try to evoke, not describe; to travel somewhere in the course of a song it has to reach out and pull me in  and keep me interested."

There seems to be this sick magnetic attraction between the emotionally available and the emotionally unavailable. This is a tongue-in-cheek look at it that also contains  elements of painful truth."      			-Diane Lindsay   Now  just as soon as I'd made up my mind  That being in love is at best a waste of time   And that as far as I could see  It wasn't worth the mess  and it's barkin' up the wrong tree   Well they're all over me - these gorgeous creatures are  All over me - all over me  All over me - it's such cruelty  They're all over me   Well I could believe what they say is true  'Cuz they probably do and besides you know I want to  But what I'll never understand  Is why time and again  They only want what they can't have   Now they're all over me - these gorgeous creatures are  All over me - all over me  All over me - you know it's cruelty  They're all over me (they love my apathy)   Now if I was ever  fool enough to say  "Put down your things and honey stay, stay, stay..."  Before my heart had even seen the light of day  I'd be watching their dust as they run, run the other way   But they're all over me - these gorgeous creatures are  All over me - all over me  All over me - it's cruelty  They love my apathy  All over me - it's plain insanity  Make them let me be...    © 1993 Slightly Tortured Music, BMI          I DON'T WANNA GEDDUP   "If this isn't self-explanatory, it's time you go have an affair..."      			 - Diane Lindsay & Miriam Cutler   I don' wanna geddup this mornin'  I'd rather stay in bed all day  I don' wanna hear the telephone ringin'  So tell the world to go away   I'd rather have your  kisses than coffee  I much prefer your lovin' to tea  And if I start to feelin' hungry  Well I know you can satisfy me   I don' wanna geddup this mornin'  I'd rather stay with you instead  I don' wanna geddup this mornin'  'Cuz I've got everything I need in bed   I don' wanna geddup (she don' wanna geddup)  You can't make me geddup (you can't make her geddup)  I'm not gonna geddup--no, no, no  I'm gonna lay around in bed all day   You know honey love  Ever since I first laid eyes on you  Something way down deep inside me has been set free  And now that we're in love, like my momma always said I would be   I'm gonna show you what you mean to me 				             I don' wanna geddup (she don' wanna geddup)  You can't make me geddup (you can't make her geddup)  I'm not gonna geddup--no, no, no  I'm gonna stay in bed all day with you   I don' wanna geddup (geddup)  I say no--you can't make me get up (geddup)  no, no, no, no, no, no, no  I'm gonna lay in bed all day with you      © 1993 Slightly Tortured Music, BMI
