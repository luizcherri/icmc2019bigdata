I see your face and I want you tonight  It's not just love I'm looking for  I died this death and now I'm bored  I always hoped for something more   my friend at the zoo says the monkeys all  stare into space  the jaguar paces, the elephant  sleeps on it's side  the porky pig people walk in  and are drawn to a look on a face  that's so frighteningly similar  to a feeling we all keep inside   porky pig people...porky pig  porky pig people...porky pig       CRYPTIC TORTURE - Song #2   20 years of cryptic torture  vomiting in front of friends  wasting time gathering fortunes  that you never get the chance to spend  		 the patient upon learning  he's no longer dying  felt guilty for asking  someone to forgive him        EMPTY POCKETS - Song #3   I'm picking at an empty pocket  could be the richest man in the world  he'd like to see through empty sockets  and there ain't nothin' left in this world   make no mistake about it  you will be riding on this train  could take you climbing up a mountain  or leave you waiting in the rain  where angels fall from dark clouds  into the doubting crowd   I once knew a man  he wrote his story down in pencil  and I said 'be careful where you store your soul,  because someone will erase it'  make no mistake about it  this is not a perfect world   I'm picking from an empty pocket  I'm picking from an empty pocket  I'm picking from an empty pocket  could be the richest man...the richest man  and angels fall from dark clouds  into the doubting crowd  angels fall from dark clouds  into the doubting crowd   Oh world, our world
