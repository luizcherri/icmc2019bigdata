Ordinary Man    All I am, an ordinary man, and Ive got some very ordinary plans I like to sit down, think, and figure out where my life is going and just what its been about.  Time, time to look ahead Time, time to look behind   Planning for the future Ill evaluate my needs, do my best and try to make each dream reality Not everything I do will all work out, like all of us, I make mistakes, a less-than-perfect cut.  And it bleeds, I see red blood run Scars go deep, and the pain lives on   There are those days when I want to...   Days turn into months turn into years, yesterdays as far away as tomorrows getting near And here I am an ordinary man, someday Ill be memories, someday Ill be dust.  Time, time to look ahead Time, time to look behind      The Hammer Song    Look at me. Its not true that no-one cares. Ill give you what kindness I can afford, but theres something I want in return:  No more penance for the power you were born with; a gift is not a crime. All you owe the world is a healthy respect. Dont let it kill your light.   Dont be afraid of the sun inside you, unveil that secret heat Youre not quite alone, and youre exactly as strong as you feel you need to be.   Dont whine at me about the weight of the world, it comes down everywhere. As friends, we can only try to even out the load, and make it a little less unfair. Pressures inside build a burning diamond, and though were all a little flawed, still if you look hard enough youll find that inner light where they got the idea for God.   Dont be afraid...
