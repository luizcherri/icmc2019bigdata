Opening with the Velvet Underground  classic "All Tomorrow's Parties", Connie grabs hold of the song  and never lets go. The band charges the opening chords with  intensity and skill, creating a 3-D wall of sound built from  electric guitars, clarinet and exotic percussion. Listening to  the next few tunes, you begin to realize that    La Strada   is no ordinary singer/songwriter debut  album.     La Strada   is truly an eclectic album. Each song  is a story, stylistically ranging from rock to jazz, retro-pop  to smoky torch song. Rarely before has there been a recording  that successfully covers so many different styles of music.  With   La Strada   Connie brings a new dimension to  alternative music.
