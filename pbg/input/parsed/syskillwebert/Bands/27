NOW  YOU MUST HEAR THE EXCITING NEW SONG BY  SCOTT BROOKMAN  BEFORE YOU GO MAD!     "EVERYTHING YOU WRITE SOUNDS TO ME LIKE DEATH"       ....is from his latest--and greatest--cassette relaese,  Scott  Brookman: A National Treasure , a stunning ten song set from Salem,  Vigrinia's own pop meister of recorded sound.  Each song on the tape has  a 100% guaranteed hummable melody.  The song you're about to hear is a  thrilling indictment of today's rock (you know who you are): tuneless  songs with no melody or harmony, I mean, I just don't get it.  And this  little number rocks as well.  I only hope that you can dig it.  And  please do.   Media Coverage of Scott Brookman:  Details, Rolling Stone, San  Francisco Examiner, The Arizona Republic, Mondo 2000, and Good Times,    all available in the "Press Coverage of IUMA" file.  Reviews of the  previous cassette have appeared in  Improvijazzanation  and will  perhaps appear in  Gajoob  and  Yellow Pills  this year.
