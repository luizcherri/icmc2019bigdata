The spoken word lyrics are  somewhere between poetry and song lyrics: there are repeated  elements as there would be in lyrics, but not bound by the  verse/chorus format. As the material is not read as a poem  would be, but spoken, the intent is for the listener to be able  to take away something of what was heard, much as being able to  remember a song's melody. In a creative blitz, 15 songs have  been written and recorded from September of 1993 to today.  KFJC, the radio station at 89.7 FM, is playing material from  the demo tapes. Other radio stations are in the works.

You're in an opium den in England. It's dark,  smoky and red hued: Blood red walls, dark red tapestries on the  floor, red velvet sofas along the walls. Whether it's the smoke  or the effect of the smoke on your mind, it's hard to tell real  from illusion, pysical from imagined. Lewis Carroll wrote about  what this feels like in  Through The Looking Glass . Enough  hints?  Listen to the song...
