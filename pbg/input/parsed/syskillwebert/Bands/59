     Distant Cousins                                                  Distant Cousins                 Elvis Did Karate                           (Excerpt 120k, 120k / Full song 2.5 mins, 2.02M, 2.70M)          College/Indie/Lo-Fi ,   Pop                         Only rarely does one come upon a distant relative that at once becomes a familiar friend, possessing shared secrets that never cease to beguile. Such is the case of  Twice Removed , the astonishingly mature debut from New York's  distant cousins .  Like their moniker, distant cousins are lower case in an upper-case world, a unique school of fish ready to burst out of a big pond with the eclectic bag of tricks they display on  Twice Removed .    First of all, these cousins are slyly deceptive.  While the playful cover art and buoyant, rambling rhythms first suggest a party band, on closer inspection  Twice Removed 's songs have dark roots that add depth to their danceability.  The album's opener, the raucous  "Elvis Did Karate"  is a camp classic, but singer/songwriter/guitarist  Catherine Dail 's husky wail imparts a simmering sensuality that's more Chrissie Hynde than downtown dilettante.  And  "Gotta Fly,"  opening with awkward, tentative bass notes reminiscent of Talking Head's "Psycho Killer," turns into a Beatlesque rocker that details the ups and downs of an obsessive relationship that refuses to end.  Even  "Tambourine Girl"  a seemingly innocuous song propelled by bright vocals and upbeat island  riddims , describes a lovable misfit unable to fit in, who "does not play the tuba, no no, because it weighs too much/And when it comes to guitar playin' that girl ain't got the touch."    Where distant cousins truly impress is their effortless  ability to shift between many musical styles, often within the same song.  Twice Removed  ranges from the chicken-scratch guitar and  blue-eyed soul of  "Pony"  (where Dail strongly tells her lover "don't ride me baby, I'm not your pony") to sophisticated, jazzy pop like the smoky  "Three Things"  and quietly longing  "Love's Here Now" .  distant cousins even manage to make having the  "Minnesota Blues"  sound like fun; combining a humorous confessional with bar-band boogie, "Minnesota Blues" suggests an unholy alliance between Laurie Anderson and the Spin Doctors.    Underscoring the masterful songwriting is distant cousins' familial musical virtuosity.  On "Elvis Did Karate" lead guitarist  Jon Diamond  brings a hard, bluesy swagger to his soloing, then switches to a mariachi stroll on  "Burning Words."  As well,  Joe "Mama" Holland 's harmonica provides a questioning  counterpoint to the lyrics on  "No Exception"  and  Fred Gildes'  subtle trombone shadings on "Pony" suggest an indecision hiding behind Dail's outwardly tough stance.  When necessary, distant cousins aren't afraid to bring in bongos, timbales, organ or piano to flesh out an already well-fed groove.  And they're no strangers to technology, either - check out the off-kilter samples that ornament the otherworldly jam session  "Lucky Magnet."     Recalling both the past and the future, distant cousins appear comfortable in their uncategorizable but homey place in-between the in-betweens.  And from the sound of  Twice Removed , these cousins won't be distant for long.  Be sure to bring the family.         distant cousins' "Twice Removed" has really hit the college radio waves with great success across the country.  The band has been on the road early in '94 from ski and college gigs in Vermont and New Hampshire to rockin' club dates in Boston, Philly, D.C. and elsewhere. On their home turf of New York City, the cousins have played to raving crowds at China Club, CBGCs, Wetlands, Village Gate, Lone Star, Bitter End, etc!  Enjoy!
