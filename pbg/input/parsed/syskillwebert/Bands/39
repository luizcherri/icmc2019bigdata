    Joyner, Eileen      Joyner, Eileen                 Always Wear Underwear                           (Excerpt 124k, 187k / Full song 3 mins, 0.19M, 3.85M)          Folk                            Eileen Joyner   You only have to ask singer/songwriter  Eileen Joyner   one question to see that she's different. If you ask most  female songwriters who their main influence has been, 90% of  them will name Joni Mitchell. Ask  Eileen  the same  question and she doesn't hesitate. "Dr. Seuss," she replies.  This is not your average folksinger.    Eileen  got her start performing in comedy clubs in  California. Although she did well in competitions, she wanted  to emphasize her music as much as her humor, something that is  not possible in the cut-throat world of stand-up comedy.   When she moved east,  Eileen  concentrated on the music scene,  quickly becoming a regular performer at folk festivals and  coffeehouses. In addition to the humorous songs she brought  with her, she began to write satirical songs about the culture  shock of living in Washington, D.C., after growing up in  California.   "...singular and damn near sociopathic..." --  The Washington  Post    " Eileen Joyner  sings about problems in El Salvador and  problems on the Beltway, about the importance of friendships  and the importance of wearing underwear." --  Alexandria  Gazzete Packet
