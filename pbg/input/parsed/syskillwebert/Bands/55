    Griffin, June      Griffin, June                 America's Sonata                           (Excerpt 120k, 120k / Full song 5 mins, 3.64M, 4.86M)          Folk ,   Experimental                               A letter from June:    I have been writing music since 1984 -- the year the "end of the world"  was predicted and found it to be rather a good beginning.  I give God all  the glory for my inspiration and I am sure there are many that claim  inspiration, but the Book of James says that every good and perfect gift  comes from the Father, and what perfection there is in my music is a gift  from the God of the United States.  It usually takes me between 10 and 20  minutes to write a song, usually less, and I rarely have corrections to  make, only minor ones, a conjunction or the like.  I am 55 this July,  should the Lord let me continue to live, and am co-owner in a dental  laboratory with my husband.  I have run for office three times, holding  up the principes of free enterprise which made this nation great and  which will explain my concern for a real market, I am founder of a  publishing company and missionary society, again in conjunction with my  wonderful husband and am an ordained minister of the gospel.  I have a  daughter and a son, two step-daughters and beloved grandchildren.  I have  dedicated my life to rebuilding America with a special dedication and  burden of bringing glory to my forefathers of God's music.  I have  written over 200 songs and poems, but find that the stronghold of  merchandising control makes it nearly impossible to promote any music  beyond what is according to someone's preplanned agenda.  The old saying  says, "Let me write the music of the nation, and I care not who writes  the laws."  I will continue to write and trust God to punish thieves and  make them pay back fourfold, in this life, as well as in eternity.   				 Sincerely - for Christ,    				 June Griffin
