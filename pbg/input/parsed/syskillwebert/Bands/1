Active in the San Francisco music scene since 	the post-punk explosion of the mid-80's, both Rayburn and 	bassist Sally Engelfried comprised two-thirds of the folk-punk 	band Yo, who delighted audiences with their three independently 	released albums on Deadbeat and Enigma Records.   	Band member Christine Wall brings to the band sweet-tinged 	vocal harmonies which made her contributions to the last two 	Chris Isaak records (including the hit "Wicked Game") so 	memorable.   	Violinist John Tenney is a veteran of stage and record whose 	solid musicianship has been appreciated by the likes of XTC, 	Van Morrison, and Frank Sinatra, with whom he has played.   	Together El Sob's quirky mix of stark yet dense lyrics and 	sweet and brooding music comprises the unique sounds you will 	hear on this tape.

Combined with the unusual instrumention--squeaky pork chop, gargling, and animal noises--this discourse makes "Skin a Cat" one of El Sob's most popular live tunes.     LYRICS   Hey diddle the cat and the fiddle  Stick it out on Chicken Little  Lucy in the Sky and the Cat in the Hat  Don't waste your time on things like that   I ain't nothing like you  I ain't nothing like you   There's more than one way to skin a cat  I live till I die and I can't come back  Koo koo ca choo and the joke's on you  Laugh in their face 'cause the things they do   I ain't nothing like you  I ain't nothing like you   Do it like me, do it like me  Do it like me  It's better like me!   Up in the sky with a thousand eyes  Everyone's looking for love at first sight  There's more than one way to skin a cat  I live till I die and I can't come back   I ain't nothing like you  I ain't nothing like you   Be more like me, be more like me  Be more like me  It's better like me!     OTHER INFO (because we don't have any press reviews!)     El Sob...and Stuff    Folk-roots rockers El Sob coined the term "Stuff Band" to describe themselves because "we're not afraid to play anything that might come our way while shopping at Thrift Town," says Christine Wall, who has been known to balance a cowbell, a glass of water for gargling, and a dog toy during the course of one song.  	"I used to play a regular electric bass," adds Sally 	Engelfried, "but I found it too limiting, so in searching for 	the right sound I had one made for me." The resulting 	one-of-a-kind instrument is striking in its piano-like 	resonance.  "I'm devoted to El Sob because this is the only 	band that lets me shake my tookus in public," comments John 	Tenney, who sometimes takes a turn at tambourine and kazoo, in 	addition to his specialties of violin and mandolin.  Bruce 	Rayburn, whose stuff most often comes from down-and-out 	cousins, has been known to write songs about stuff and his 	cousins. "I got Christine's dumbek for her from an old 	girlfriend who owed me," says Rayburn gleefully.     MERCHANDISE DESCRIPTION    	  YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE STUFF, NOW HEAR THE 	STUFF!
