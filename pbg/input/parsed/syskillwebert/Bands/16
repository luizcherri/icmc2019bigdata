After three independent releases on the Figurehead label, he felt that it was time to focus on writing lyrics and music that was a little more raw and a little less serious than what Braille Closet was doing.     In early 1993, Bill started the Canned Corn label.  The first release in Spring of 1993 was Redbug's "Blue Light Special" b/w "Downtown" 7-inch.  The single received good airplay in a few markets and none in a lot.  Redbug played a few shows with various members: drummer Brian Maguire (currently with Jacksonville's Dave Ronan and the Hootowls) and bassist Andrew Dalio (also of Disco Biscuit).  Blair had been working on a solo project and was recruited to sing on the record and play bass on a mini-tour since Andrew's other band keeps him real busy.    The session for the current album, "No Muffins For Shadow!," started as a session for another 7-inch.  Engineer Mark Ignoffo had worked with Smashing Pumpkins in their early days, and the band was impressed with a lot of the music coming out of his studio, Reel Time.  Mark didn't know what to think of Redbug at first.  The band didn't care.  They just wanted to take advantage of his 20 hours for $500.00 special.  Two of the songs on the album, "Hush Puppy" and "Steely Cowsdell," were improvisational jams that ended up on the record.  Also included on the C.D. are wacky versions of Deep Purple's "Highway Star" and Pearl Jam's "Black."  "Blue Light Special" and "Downtown" were remixed and included on the disc also.  "Astro-Manta-Ray" is a tribute to one of the band's faves, Man or Astro-Man.  The song "Funky Nassau" available here is a eulogy to our now defunct bowling league, Crush Crush Crush.     Redbug's music was described in Minneapolis' YOUR FLESH as "proficient country-dork spoo."  Charlotte's THE INDIE FILE described them as "They Might Be Giants with some real talent." The bands influences range from The Outlaws and Buck Owens to the B-52's and X.  They prefer not to be categorized, but if need be, call 'em cow-dork-punk.
