Then the lyrics are repeated with  AWESOME music.  We repeat the Spanish and English words and  phrases up to 4 times for the longer phrases.   YOU DO NOT  GET BORED  because your mind fixates on the music and you  pick up the Spanish the way you pick up words to your favorite  song.   YOUR MIND BECOMES BILINGUAL.     The Result   You may be in a Spanish Restaurant and hear "Disculpame."  Right  away you think "Excuse Me."  It becomes automatic.  You  actually think in English but speak in Spanish (in the  beginning.)    History of  RAPANESE    Rapanese was created by a Canadian, ex-disc jockey, school  teacher, Mike D'Amours.  He started using Rapanese in his  classroom of 25 students in 1989.  Since then, the Kelowna  Secondary School, B.C. Canada, has had to hire a second  language instructor to cope with the 5 fold increase in  demand in only 2 years.
