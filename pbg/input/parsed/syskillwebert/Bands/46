    Coat                Squirrel                           (Excerpt 120k, 181k / Full song 3:41 mins, 2.65M, 5.31M)          College/Indie/Lo-Fi                                    Coat 's roller coaster "Squirrel" is a turbulent mix of noisy grinding guitars, hushed feverish vocals, rockin' nimble bass and smashing drums, all packed into  one of the most intriguing three and a half minute pop singles in recent memory.       	Featured on L.A.'s New Alternative CD Compilation  	Executive Producer:Joe Berman/SmartRecordings  	Producer Mike Bosley/Engineer Geoff Siegel Recorded at the Sandbox          	"...a little Jane's-ish, a little Nirvana-ish, with subdued punk  	overtones."        - Prince of Darkness, L.A.'s Underground/Rock City News                BAND DESCRIPTION:    Coat has heavy, crunchy guitars with melodic vocal hooks, and ass kickin'  rhythms!!  Los Angeles based male/female foursome.    "...a nice noisy slap in the face! Heavy, richly textured powerful proto-pop."     - Chuck Crisafulli, KCRW 89.9 FM          REVIEWS:    "...heavy, enveloping pop-noise grooves."    - LA Weekly      "Musically versatile & engaging with a penchant for layered pop-thrash guitars and  vocal/instrument interplay."    - Natalie Nichols, The Reader      "Heavy alternative that digs into a bent groove and jams it about, with each  instrument adding a bit of life to the story."    - Gena Nason, BAM      "COAT are probably the most interesting live unsigned bands in Los Angeles right  now."  	   - The Producer Report        This band combines two dense guitars layers with dramatically shifting song  dynamics without sounding messy and contrived. Fused with playful structural psychadelics, this combination results in an explosive burst of pop that's been turned  upside down, melded with darkness, and produces an intoxicating brew of melodic  whimsy. Coat pushes the limits of noise!   With their boy-girl-boy-girl line up, Coat can come off as gratifyingly raw or  gleamingly pop. Yet this L.A. based quartet has a limitless capacity for drawing one in with  achy guitar melodies. Their hyper-hypnotic rhythms combined with oddly accessible pop  hooks, create a natural flowing buoyancy. If you like your pop hard and heavy combined  with an avalanche of punched up riffs, then check out Coat!
