Do those     &gt; sheep just roam the hill side fending for themselves?  Are there any     &gt; predators left?     In 1915 here in the hills of what is now Orange County, We killed off  the great predator of California that used to roam those valleys, The  Grizzley Bear.    They are, alas, no more, tho I wouldn't want to fend off the bears to  do an FMR.    I don't think the Mountain Lions come down that far into the desert  and the Foxes don't pose much of a threat to the sheep.  The coyotes  might be the only predator.
