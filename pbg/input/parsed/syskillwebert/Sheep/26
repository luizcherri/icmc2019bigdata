        The Sheepeaters: Indians of Yellowstone     The Sheepeaters:  Keepers of the  Past        When the first white men visited Yellowstone in the  early nineteenth century, a group of reclusive Shoshone-speaking Indians  known as the Sheepeaters inhabited the Plateau.  They had neither guns nor  horses and lived a stone-age lifestyle, hunting the Rocky Mountain Bighorn  sheep for food and clothing.  Modern Archeology and Anthropology along with  first-hand accounts of trappers and explorers help to tell the story of The  Sheepeaters: Keepers of the Past.  	 This is a video for people of all ages that reveals the story of  prehistoric Indians living in Yellowstone before it became the world's first  National Park.  Vivid illustrations by Delores Dinsmore and authoritative  narration by Dr. Les Davis of the Museum of the Rockies bring alive the story of  these Native Americans.
