"If you make the wolves the  &gt; guardians of the sheep, it will turn them into sheep dogs." &gt;  &gt; When you've already got more priveleges than God, you don't have to try  &gt; to break into the system in order to get them.  Once you have them, you  &gt; generally then are of the mindset to want to keep them.  Now this is just silly.  If you think this would stop *ALL* hacking/cracking whatever you are being deceived.  There are more reasons for hacking than getting more priveledge than God.  People who break into systems can often get more priveledge than you could possibly give them if this is their goal.  Then there are people who hack just because hacking is fun.  And what about those people who are already admins and  yet still hack into other peoples machines?  &gt; Paul Robinson - Paul@TDR.COM &gt; Voted "Largest Polluter of the (IETF) list" by Randy Bush &lt;randy@psg.com&gt;              Next message:   *Hobbit*: "iss equivalents"     Previous message:   Casper Dik: "Re: passwd -F"     In reply to:   Paul Robinson: "The ISS Program"       Next in thread:   Gene Spafford: "Re: wolves and sheep on the inet"
