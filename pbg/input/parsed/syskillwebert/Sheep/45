     Blade Runner / Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?    What Book is   Based on?   Blade Runner is loosely based on a   Philip K. Dick :  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  ( DADoES ).  The least one can say about the film adaptation is that it borrowed a number of concepts and characters from the book.  Dick also wrote the short story that    Total Recall   was based on,  We Can Remember It For You, Wholesale .  A recurring theme in Dick's work is the question of personal and human identity.   A question explored more in  DADoES  and  Total Recall  than in  Blade Runner  is "what is reality?"   You are most likely to find  DADoES  in a second-hand bookstore.  It has been re-printed as:  Blade Runner (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) .   The title comes from Alan E. Nourse, who wrote a story called  The Bladerunner .   William S. Burroughs  took the book and wrote  Bladerunner (A Movie)  in 1979. Rights to the title only ("in perpetuity") were sold to   Ridley Scott .  Similarities between Nourse's  The Bladerunner  and Scott's  Blade Runner  are in name only.  Nourse's title refers to people who deliver medical instruments to outlaw doctors who can't obtain them legally. Scott thought the title made a good codename for Deckard.   Some of the "visuals" were inspired by a story from   Dan O'Bannon  and Moebius (  Jean Giraud ) called    The Long Tomorrow   in an issue of the French  Wonders of the Universe  comic book series.  The back of the comic book says (translated from French):         This comic-book also contains other famous stories,       like "The Long Tomorrow", which originally was thought       to be a parody, but ended up being more real, than what       it was meant to be a parody of: the classic American       detective-story.  This story was later used as a visual       reference for the movie "Blade Runner."   Giraud did the costume design for the Walt Disney movie  Tron , for which   Syd Mead  did the mechanical design.            Murray    muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au
