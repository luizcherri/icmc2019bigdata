"If you make the wolves the  &gt; &gt; guardians of the sheep, it will turn them into sheep dogs."  There is little evidence to show that people with experience breaking into computer systems have any particular talent for protecting them.  A few may have some specific insights, and a rare few may have general background, but that is not the general case.  For instance, being able to guess someone's password doesn't mean someone is able to design a cryptographic algorithm to protect passwords; and being able to exploit a race condition doesn't mean one knows how to write effective code without them.  It's also the case that sheepdogs that ever stray and kill a lamb must themselves be put down.  Once they've been a sheep killer, there is no way to ever trust them not to do it again -- the temptation might be too much for them on another occasion.  Ask a shepherd.  --spaf              Next message:   John Hawkinson: "Re: [8lgm]-Advisory-7.UNIX.passwd.11-May-1994"     Previous message:   Gene Spafford: "Re: [8lgm]-Advisory-7.UNIX.passwd.11-May-1994"     In reply to:   Timothy Newsham: "wolves and sheep on the inet"       Next in thread:   Steve Simmons: "Re: wolves and sheep on the inet"
