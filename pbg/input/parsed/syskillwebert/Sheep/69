    Berkeley Inktomi Search Engine        U. C. Berkeley Inktomi Research Prototype                Enter up to 10 words as your query. Inktomi will return the documents that contain those words, ranked by how many of the words each document contains, and by their relative importance.  Use "+berkeley" to indicate that the word  berkeley  must be in the document; use "-berkeley" to indicate that it must not.        for words:    Return 	  	 10 documents 	 20 documents 	 30 documents 	 50 documents 	 100 documents 	   displaying results with            Full Graphics          Text Only          Terse Text Only         Just put spaces between the words, don't use any numbers or symbols. Words shorter than three letters or very common words, such as  is ,  and , or  the , are ignored.  The system will remove common endings, such as  ing  and  ed , from your words and search for matches that share the same root.  For example,  watching  will match words like  watch ,  watched , etc.           Home  |  Search  |  Add URLs       Email:    brewer@cs.berkeley.edu ,  gauthier@cs.berkeley.edu    Berkeley's Inktomi research is sponsored in part by  ARPA ;  Sun Microsystems  donated our equipment.
