This kind of presumtion is both foolish and  &gt; dangerous. The world is a complex place, and while making analogies offers &gt; a tool to simplify it, it also simplifies it. Too often these sorts of &gt; debates fall victim to sophmoric logical faults, most commonly those  &gt; associated with ambiguity &amp; equivocation. As well it seems the argumentative &gt; fallacies seem especialy prone to abuse, particularly Argumentum ad Hominem &amp; &gt; &amp; False Cause fallacies.  &gt;   lots of pretentious crap deleted  &gt; The world IS a complex place. False arguments on the net DO waste &gt; bandwith. &gt;  &gt; 			Tim Scanlon &gt;    It's all very well proposing that we all give thoroughly rigorous arguments, but as you say, most of us do not have a classical education. Therefore I suggest you dont waste bandwidth with the dictionary that you swallowed, or waste our time having to read this verbose twaddle.
