The  STAR  sheep management  system has been developed to help solve these two problems.  It is a  systematic schedule with 5 lambing periods evenly spaced throughout the year for  continuity of production.  Each ewe can lamb 5 times in 3 years or 1.67 times a  year for increased production.  Coupling this increase in lambing frequency with  an increased lambing rate, we are now realizing an annual lamb production of  about 3 lambs per ewe.  The  STAR  was developed by Brian  Magee, Cornell Sheep Farm Manager, and the figure depicts the  STAR
