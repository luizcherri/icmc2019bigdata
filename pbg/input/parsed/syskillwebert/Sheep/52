       Desert Bighorn Sheep              Desert Bighorn Sheep      . . . . . Ovis canadensis mexicana        SIZE: Length of adult ram, 50 inches; weight, 200 lbs.     RANGE: Western and southern Arizona; Chihuahua and Sonora Mexico.     HABITAT: Rocky ridges and buttes.     DIET: Herbivore; grasses, herbs, shrubs, cactus and cactus fruit.     LIFE SPAN: 15 - 20 years.     STATUS: Once protected because of loss of habitat from human invasion and competition with domestic and exotic animals. Population now increasing and being reintroduced into former ranges.       ADAPTATIONS:       ANATOMY: Both sexes have horns. The female's horns are slimmer and shorter than the massive curled horns of the ram.  SENSES: Good peripheral and depth vision allows it to move over mountainsides without falling, and to maintain allaround surveillance of the area.  LOCOMOTION: The outer edge of the hoof is hard and enables the sheep to stand on the tiniest projection. The sole is soft and rubberlike, which helps it to cling to smooth surfaces and cushion the impact when jumping.  HABITS: The ram uses his horns in fighting for breeding rights. Horns may also be used to obtain food and as a defense against predators.  DEFENSE: Escapes into inaccessible rocky areas and fights with horns as weapon.  SOCIAL UNIT: Males live in separate herds from the females and the last year's young. At the start of the breeding season, the males fight for harems, and then, with their females, separate into new herds until that season is over.  MISC.: The Desert Bighorn can go without drinking water for extended periods. It relies on the moisture in vegetation, especially cactus.
