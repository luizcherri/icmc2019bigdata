     Police Halt Sheep Load Bound for Shoreham         Police Halt Sheep Load Bound for Shoreham    From  The News , Portsmouth, England, April 28, 1995.    Protesters hail intervention near Brighton a victory.    Police stopped a lorry carrying live animal exports bound for Shoreham Harbour today and ordered the driver not to try to reach the port.   It was the first lorry to be halted following the decision by Sussex Police to limit police escorts for exporters.   As hundreds of protesters gathered at the port today, a lorry from  Cheltenham carrying sheep was halted six miles away near Brighton.   The shippers, International Traders Ferries, are believed to have sent the lorry to test the resolve of the police.   ITF's director Bill Ford was with the lorry as it was pulled over by Chief Inspector Kelly McCartney and the driver warned not to continue.   A video cameraman, believed to be with ITF, filmed the incident while a Ministry of Agriculture vet inspected the 176 sheep and passed them fit.   A spokesman for the lorry owners, G G Gilder, of Cheltenham, Gloucs. said the load was bound for Shoreham.   He said in Cheltenham "I will be extremely annoyed if one of my lorries  which is roadworthy and fully insured has been stopped on the Queen's  highway for whatever reason."   Demonstrators at the port hailed the latest incident in the four-month  battle to halt animal shipments to France as a triumph.   One said: "We are absolutely delighted. I have never believed the police  were in favour of this kind of thing."   Sussex Chief Constable Paul Whitehouse announced recently that his officers would only provide escorts for exporters delivering to Shoreham for two days each week.
