Goudy quotes re: sheep rustling. The    &gt;first (less common; I place it first only because I had read it first) is    &gt;"Anyone who would letterspace blackletter would steal sheep." The second    &gt;is the same quote except about lower case rather than blackletter. I am    &gt;inclined to believe that the first is the "real" quote and the second a    &gt;misquote. I have seen specific citation (occasion, date, etc.) on the first,    &gt;although I have not seen contemporary first person citation. Also, we are    &gt;basically conservative beings and tend to believe that whatever we saw first    &gt;is right, original, proper, etc. and any subsequent variation is wrong,    &gt;derivative, heresy, etc. (In other words, I have no idea whether I believe    &gt;it simply because it is something I believe.)    &gt;    &gt;I haven't made any real effort to hunt this down, so don't go to any trouble,    &gt;but if someone can answer this easily, I'd appreciate it.    &gt;    &gt;Thanks,    &gt;    &gt;Gunnar    &gt;    &gt;Gunnar Swanson Design Office    &gt;739 Indiana Avenue, Venice, California 90291-2728 USA    &gt;310/399-5191  fax:310/399-2675    &gt;    &gt;                                     |||                                   (0-0)  oOO-*-*-*-*-*(_)   | Peter D.
