 SOP FOR ANTIBODY PRODUCTION SHEEP      Sheep have been tested negative via florescent antibody      technique for Q-fever by the vendor.  Sheep will be retested      upon arrival by LAR using elisa technique.     No women of childbearing years will work with the sheep.       Technicians will be assigned to the sheep which will be housed      in the large animal cubicle.   The room will remain locked during the day and will be signed with "Restricted Entry".     Technicians will care for the sheep as the last duty of the      day.  The use of masks is strongly recommended.  Technicians      will launder the uniforms each day and wipe shoes with a      bleach solution.  Technicians should shower prior to leaving      the facility.     The animals will be housed on raised wire caging.  The pens      will be hosed down daily by a technician wearing LAR provided      uniforms, disposable gloves, shoes that remain at the animal      facility.     Contaminated surfaces will be disinfected with 1:100 dilution      of household chlorine bleach that contains 5.25% hypochlorite.     The animals will be fed alfalfa cubes rather than hay to      minimize potential contamination.  The sheep will be sheared      prior to purchase.  Male sheep or non pregnant females will be      used.     Medical Monitoring Procedures:   No individual will work with      sheep without a current serum reference sample on file, as      well as having met all other requirements of the Medical      Monitoring Program.     A training session to inform the affected LAR staff of the      potential hazards of Q-fever and the symptoms most often      associated with the illness will be provided.     Personnel will be advised to seek medical attention if they      develop a  febrile illness compatible with that of Q-fever .
